        "selftext": "I might be a little late on this but after finally watching, here‚Äôs my take: \n\nGrieffs wife may have walked in on him cheating. That line, \"If you love someone, don‚Äôt come home early,\" feels like a major hint. In a fit of rage, she strangles his mistress. Grieff, out of love or guilt, decides to take the blame. Since he‚Äôs a criminal psychology expert, he stages everything to make it look like he killed his wife in a moment of madness. She goes into hiding in the UK. \n\nIt seems like the police simply accepted Grieff‚Äôs confession and didnt do any further investigating. All they focused on was finding the missing head - to bury her body whole. Grieff knows that if they were ever to find the head it would show that the woman they buried was not his wife ...\n\nFast forward to when Janice bumps into Beth on the train. Although she'd been the one to publicly stand up for Beth, she is very reluctant to chat further and refused multiple times to be interviewed. She also mentioned not having Facebook. She had a very \"loner\" attitude and didn't want to be in the public eye.  \n\nBeth then received the distress message from Janice and essentially starts the process of finding her \"friend\" with Grieff... after long debate. \n\nAlthough Grieff has insane resources at hand.. he seems to know just that little bit more about Janice as the investigation continues. He knew that she had a Skype call with her sister that she never misses... did he know that because he knew his wife would never abandon her sister... even if she was in hiding ...The matter of how he got that information before getting into her apartment is suspect. \n\nWhile Janice is trapped she is very strategic and understanding of her circumstances. Taking very tactical measures in attempt to escape... leading me to believe she has this knowledge from growing up with a mafia dad or (more likely) from being married to a criminal psychologist... she's not just a regular math tutor. \n\nAs we all know, the Vicars wife is killed and he is arrested. Him and Grieff are shown on a call together. The Vicar argues to Grieff that he is not a murderer and he did not murder anyone. To which Grieff replies.. \"Oh you didn't murder Janice - But if you hadn't have acted the way you did, would your wife still be alive?\" \n\nHe wants the Vicar to understand that it was solely his actions that resulted in someone's death.. just as his had resulted in the same. They're not so different after all. \n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about the scene where Janice visits Grieff on death row. Their interaction feels... familiar, more than a mere acquaintance from the ordeal. \nDillon‚Äôs grin when the guards leave the room shows that there is a mischievous atmosphere between them. \n\nWhen Janice says, \"I understand you'll be dead in a week,\" Grieff replies with, \n\"Do you? Personally, I'm having a little trouble with the fact of my execution.\" \nThe way he emphasizes \"fact of my\" feels like he‚Äôs mocking her slightly. \n\nJanice explains why she‚Äôs meeting with them - her husband's murder. Dillon says \n\"With all due respect, you do know your husband isn‚Äôt actually dead.\" \nHis mannerisms seem like he's hinting towards an inside joke. \nJanice‚Äôs response, \"No, but he deserves to be,\" obviously still holding on to a bit of cold blood and referring to his betrayal. \n\nShe asks him why he seems surprised at this.. \n\nGrieff then says, \"This is death row, Janice. We're all murderers here,\" and she grins knowingly... as, theoretically, there are 3 murderers in that room. \n\nIt feels like Janice, after being saved by her husband for a second time, and hearing that he will be executed in a week (because he refused to give up the head/real story), had a change of heart and wanted to plan how they could get away with his \"murder\" and ultimately break him out. \n\nAs for Janice‚Äôs father, his involvement in shady stuff‚Äîmaybe CSAM‚Äî that might explain why Janice was so (annoyingly) triggered by what was on the flash drive.\n\nMaybe introducing an impulsive gangster of a father hints towards why she‚Äôs a bit of a psychopath herself.\n\nAnd maybe that‚Äôs why Beth doesn‚Äôt write the story... She knows the truth now and wants to protect her identity.\n\nAny thoughts? \n",

It feels like season one was all for nothing, seeing as they are still in the game for some reason. Time passes, the characters keep doing the video game thing, but somethings off. Anyway, long story short, season two doesn‚Äôt have the main characters in it at all. These are clones, perfect copies yes but they aren‚Äôt the original MCs. The original characters are in the real world. I figured this out on episode three. Unlike with the original season one, I immediately knew what was going on pretty much from the get go. \n\nIesperately want to know what happened from there? But I guess we will never know seeing as it got canceled. Not surprised how bad that season was. I would‚Äôve loved it if we had gotten a take two almost. They are a team are they not? They would play hollow over and over again. I would‚Äôve loved to see the same three characters in a different  game of hollow. perhaps new sides of their characters and dynamics would show in different environments? Starting from scratch, no memories. Alternatively, I would‚Äôve loved to see how their lives continued in the real world after the game. Their relationships, etc, etc. What we got was so boring and low stakes in comparison.\n\n  \napparently, a lot of people loved it. So happy for you.

She seemed like an accomplished researcher, author and advisor to companies like Hinge which is so cool. I‚Äôve also heard some of her original sound bites on dating that seemed mostly decent. \n\nHowever I was a bit let down by her appearance on the show. First of all, I felt she had very little personality. She came off as quite meek, and bland, and if anything, the participants facilitated the scenes and kept things energized. \n\nI also felt like her coaching moments were a mixed watch - some were insightful and effective, but others were lacking, and others came off as even a bit abrasive. \nFor example, there were many dates that went relatively well and had good potential, but the participant wrote it off quickly. This isn‚Äôt uncommon in modern dating. But as a coach, Logan just agreed with the dater, rather than maybe challenging them to try one more - and I think this caused some people to lose out on connections that could have developed a bit more time. \nOr another example - she tore into the lady with the big glasses - attacking her glasses choice and also telling her that her personality is too big. IMO Logan, as a coach, could have more gently engaged with the lady, rather than potentially making her self-conscious and feel put-down. It also just seemed odd to me to target her fashion choice, when the woman clearly puts in soooo much effort and presents herself thoughtfully. It‚Äôs not like on Queer Eye when a makeover is part of the deal.\n\nI think Logan is a smart lady! But I think she might be better suited for research‚Ä¶or for consulting on a show like this - with someone more charismatic in the spotlight (this is national tv after all).\n\nWhat are everyone else‚Äôs thoughts?\n",

        "selftext": "Netflix only wants instant sensational hits so if it‚Äôs not instantly discovered and instantly popular within one month of release they‚Äôre just gonna abandon it before it gets discovered\nBut the problem with that is, they do nothing to advertise the new shows outside of their platform\nAnd the the form of advertisement they do have is absolutely terrible\nIt‚Äôs advertising the product Netflix not individual shows \n\nEveryone knows the name of Netflix so start using that data you‚Äôve collected to have targeted ad campaigns so you can run advertisements for shows and movies that you think people would like\n\nDiscoverability of Netflix doesn‚Äôt need to be done, but discoverability of Netflix shows need more of it \n\nBecause I‚Äôve noticed a lot of shows do not get discovered, because there is absolutely no advertisement outside of Netflix, and even with in Netflix it was badly advertised\n\nIf they want to actually have TV shows that actually are successful give them some breathing room like if it‚Äôs obviously a failure all the reviews online are saying it‚Äôs bad. We hated it don‚Äôt make anymore. Sure maybe that‚Äôs a sign that it‚Äôs a horrible TV show. \n\nBut if everyone‚Äôs talking good about the show, even though you‚Äôre not reaching  the preferred metrics of 80% completion or more within a week\nAnd even then that doesn‚Äôt matter there‚Äôs shows that meat Netflix is arbitrary metrics, and they decide to cancel it anyways \nIf you want to show to be successful, give it some breathing room, Bojack Horseman Netflix always goes on about how Bojack Horseman is there really good, animated, cartoon  because they gave breathing room\nBojack horseman, season one and two sucked \nBut by the end, it was a cultural masterpiece, because you gave the breathing room to the writers to actually write some thing instead of just abandoning ship. As soon as you don‚Äôt meet your preferred metrics. \n\nIf Netflix released any TV shows that were big hits in the early 2000s they would‚Äôve cancelled them \n\nI understand their business to make money, but maybe instead of putting your profits into horrible movies that nobody wants to watch \nMaybe start putting it into TV shows and movies that people actually want to watch \n\nBecause the majority of shows that are actually really good nugget cancel Netflix doesn‚Äôt give us a reason but there‚Äôs tons of shows that are horrible dog shit with barely any ratings and Netflix keeps it going \n\nIt‚Äôs just Netflix does not allow users to discover new shows before they cancel it \n\nYou have to know every show that comes out on Netflix\nEven though they do not advertise when they‚Äôre coming out or what they come out with half the time \n\nI‚Äôm not following Netflix is Twitter every single day checking their Twitter account every single day for the new release because 90% of their posts are absolute brain rot Just to keep them relevant. \n\n\nJust stop cancelling shows \nBefore people discover them \n\nIf it‚Äôs 50% or more in the first season, give it a second season greenlight \n\nWe don‚Äôt expect you to buy five seasons at a time \n\nAnd if popularity is dying off before the show is released, you can just cancel it and cut your losses \nDo that with every other movie they think it‚Äôs going to do bad \n\n\nAnd another thing that is more of the movie industry problem than Netflix problem is companies expect movies to do poorly and they‚Äôre really good. They expect movies to do really good and they do poorly so maybe stop cancelling those movies you think you‚Äôre gonna flop  the couple of uptight critics said it would\n\nBecause time and time again, I see a movie come out critics say it‚Äôs going to be horrible\nAnd people love it \n\nLook at the Mario movie everyone said it gonna be horrible. All the critics were against it.\nAs soon as it came out, everybody loved it \n\nAnd that‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve noticed with a lot of movies critics when they hate a movie and think that it should be cancelled before it gets released so they can get a pay out \nBecause it‚Äôs only 80% complete\n\nMaybe finish the movie and release it because if you think it‚Äôs gonna do bad, it‚Äôs gonna be good\nIf you think it‚Äôs gonna be good, it‚Äôs gonna be bad",

Why are they not treating the place as a crime scene? Why isn‚Äôt he taken back to the station to file a formal report?\nHow does a lawman fail to recognize the difference between running over a nail and a textbook slashed tire on the side wall? Why would the reporter be considered or treated as a suspect off the bat? just because he's a writer, he's automatically a body chopping homicidal individual? this is no Jussie Smollett case,(all though even his \"assailants\" were taken under better preliminary scrutiny) it's a possible cartelish sounding case with professionals at hand, which is far more pressing. yes, there's little proof to corroborate his story, but can a real cop tell us what would have taken place if a CNN or Fox personality with news media influence came to them with such a story?\nWhy hasn‚Äôt the reporter contacted his colleagues at the station? And why would he even stay near that property alone after the police left?\nThis isn‚Äôt a critique of the characters in this pilot ep.‚Äîit's about the story writing.

This show had that 3x over, and did so wonderfully, BUT with so much to cover, I think the amount of minutes it took to do that may have been a factor that made it hard for me to get invested in much earlier than I did.\n\nAgain, being that the amount of time it took to take off was my only real issue, I am sincerely hoping that the next seasons kind of roll on a bit more quickly.\n\nAnd anyone that was a MEGA fan of the series...\nWhich season is your favorite?\nAny recommendations for after?\nThx!",

And even this show had a LOT of cons. I do like historical satire tho like 1670. If you are making a show about a real historical person make it ACCURATE. If its a made up story , go for it. hate hero/villain movies. I dont like usless diversity and pointless romance(sex scenes). I enjoy thriller, comedy, a bit of drama doesnt hurt. I dont like Sci-fi. I love it when the movie is in the language where the story is happening. I like nature, advanture. I LOVE EPICS (Ben hur, Lawrence of Arabia) I  watch a show for the story and i frequently drop shows because they get too repetitive and generic .

The dog thing just gave me anxiety (I always worry about ppl feeding my dog things he can't eat, so even her pushing the cookies near the dog made me uneasy), so no laughs for me there.

        "selftext": "If you're anything like me, you often have Netflix on while you do routine tasks or play casual games. Picture-in-picture (PiP) was wonderful. The \"upgrade\" away from version 6.99.5 has effectively crippled the Netflix app -- downloads are no longer supported, and PiP is not readily available.\n\nThere are 2 reliable methods to enable PiP with Netflix in its current state. I expect these solutions to continue to work, since they're supported by Microsoft/Google/Mozilla developers for non-Netflix applications too. Here's your options:\n\n1. __Use web browser's built-in PiP functionality. (Prefer MS Edge)__\n\n   - Microsoft Edge has the same video quality as the Netflix app, though subtitles will not show in the PiP window, nor will the arrow keys function to skip forward/backward. \n   - Firefox/Chrome/Chromium is intentionally capped in bitrate by Netflix. Reduced video and audio quality compared to the app/Edge. Specifically, it tags video for lower quality and older codecs, and often 128kbit vs 192 kbit audio. It may not make a difference in every show/movie or in conjunction with windowed mode and mixed audio.\n   - Firefox specifically supports subtitles while in PiP mode, a must-have for foreign languages or quiet dialogue.\n   - Browser PiP often needs to be reset when playback skips to a new video (next episode). Close PiP window and re-open it for the new episode.\n\n\n2. __\"Always On Top\" function provided by Microsoft PowerToys.__ Install first, then enable via setting and shortcut keys.\n\n   - To enable this module, turn it on under the Context Menu (Windowing & Layouts) or Dashboard (Disabled Modules).\n   - To put Netflix above all, have PowerToys open in the background/minimized, click the Netflix window so it's focused in the foreground, and use the \"WIN + CTRL + T\" shortcut to enable \"Always On Top\". Change the shortcut bind if you must, in settings.\n   - Borders generated by PowerToys can be disabled by clicking on AlwaysOnTop header to open settings in the PowerToys interface. \n   - However, the Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons and the window title bar cannot be hidden without editing the Netflix app itself.\n\nMicrosoft PowerToys on Microsoft Store: [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp89dcgq3k6vld)\n\nREMINDER: Games and other apps must not be in exclusive Fullscreen mode. Windowed or Borderless will allow Netflix to stay on top.\n\nIMPORTANT: Microsoft Edge's PiP button is occasionally hidden unless you pause-play the video. Something about the menu option depends on playback being started by the user (not auto-played). When in doubt, pause-play the video first, right-click on the window tab for Netflix and choose \"Enter picture in picture\"; specifically it should be nestled between the \"Mute\" and \"Send to device\" options.\n\nHappy multi-tasking!",

Additionally, the plot felt rushed and convoluted, failing to build upon the strong foundation established in the first season. It's as if Netflix tried to replicate the success of Season 1 without understanding the core elements that made it special.\nWhat have you done Netflix? ",

        "selftext": "I had a free weekend and the second season of arcane came out, but didn't remember the first season at all, so it was a no-brainer, 2 days, 2 seasons, simple and easy. The first season is a masterpiece, it's the usual first season of a show that gets people into the world, into the story, into the characters and cuts off right before everything is about to go wild and MY GOD Arcane does all the above so goddamn well, after the first season you know what each character is after, how fucked up they are, what are their ambitions and all of that accompanied by stunning visuals, great music and heart-ripping drama. The second season starts off right where the first one left off, the Act 1 and Act 2 (Ep.1-6) just keep pounding you with head-blowing action, neck-breaking music and berries you under your own teers, at the same fucking time! Honestly wasn't expecting this amount of drama mid season, though it kinda makes sense, because the ending isn't as... now, idk what adjective to pick to not downgrade the ending, I mean it's a great ending, it finishes all the character arcs nicely and very satisfyingly. but it's not something epic and world changing, would call it a peaceful ending. Also the story overall is great, but I'm not sure why people keep dying, just so in the next episode they're back on their feet, but it doesn't feel like they're out of their place, I just can't trust the show to actually kill someone, forever. The music is another thing I would like to mention, it's always nice to see when creators aren't afraid to put music over action and basically everything else, but when they've spent a gazillion bucks on the amazing tracks, made by great musicians, WHY THE HELL NOT!? I mean anybody that says the music distracts the viewer, more than \"fills the glass of emotions to the top\", just hasnt seen how a monsterous beast chasesa character while heavy guitars are playing in the background or how the music gets in that crack of your heart after a lovely character dies and just rips your heart half in two. Arcane is an amazing show that left me speechless for the rest of the day and recommend it to everyone, no matter what style of animation you like, no matter what music you enjoy, it has everything for everybody and it matters not wether you like LoL or not, Arcane works as well as any other show as a stand alone piece of art.",

        "selftext": "Okay, I really hope I'm not the only one who has noticed and is disturbed by how apps from the Microsoft Store now work. Specifically, Netflix, Crunchyroll, YouTube Music, Facebook Messenger, and who knows how many others (probably plenty more).\n\nThe way these applications now function is by essentially using the Microsoft Edge browser. Instead of opening an app, you're basically just opening a browser tab. These \"apps\" rely on Edge's settings and even redirect links to Edge when it's not your default browser. In other words, you no longer get any of the functionality you'd expect from a standalone app. It's literally the same experience as opening the webpage in Edge. How does that even qualify as an application?!\n\nWhat's worse is that if anyone somehow manages to uninstall or delete Edge from their computer, or if a buggy update breaks it, I bet all these so-called \"apps\" will stop working entirely.\n\nI really hope nobody tries to defend this practice because it's indefensible.\n\nRight now, I'm furious about the disappearance of the Netflix app. The app used to let me directly connect to my home theatre receiver and send high-quality audio with surround sound support. That‚Äôs gone now‚Äîthanks a lot.   \nOn top of that, I'm facing a huge issue with Netflix lowering the resolution when playing via the browser (or the \"app\") for absolutely no good reason. I can see how it quickly buffers about 4 minutes of video, but after playing for just a few seconds, it drops the quality, it stutters, rewinds a second, and starts redownloading another 4 minutes of video. This cycle repeats, and the quality keeps dropping until it hits the lowest resolution, which in my case watching on a big screen makes it unbearable. \n\nAnd yes, before anyone asks:\n\n* My profile is set to high-quality playback.\n* I have a fast, stable internet connection (110 Mbps is more than enough).\n* I'm using a solid gaming build, so there are no hardware issues.\n\nI even tried installing an old Chrome extension called *Netflix 1080p* made by Truedread, because this problem has existed for years. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked yet, I will play around with settings and source code further in attempts to resolve this.\n\nI am new to posting on reddit so if I have not done something right please let me know ( I know you want to).\n\n",

Even with being a gamer, I have zero experience with LOL. I see this show as a Animated Action Drama and do not care about the lore of the extended universe.\n\nThe Animation: absolutely stunning, and there is nothing like it. This may be the only reason I finish the show.\n\nOh my god.... who do you actually like in this show? Vander is so clearly a means to an end from the first time you see him. He IS the motivation, not a character. It is ridiculous how many overblown tropes are used in this show. Vi is pretty alright, but she is laser driven on one thing always and the plot is whatever is in her way. This show is murphys law in action as anything and everything goes wrong for these characters. Highs and Lows, breaks from tension.... that is what makes a show.\n\nHextech is the most refreshing part of the story because while the unlimited power thing is kind of an overdone trope, its well written. (Good job guys)\n\nYou know exactly what the characters are going to do before they even know it. Jinx is not a character, she is a plot device and magguffin. No.... actually, I really like the parts where Jinx goes nuts and snubs any chance of the story progressing...\n\nThe characters are always talking about the same damn thing throughout the whole season and don't learn a single thing. Maybe we could get the people from the underground actually doing something to help their people for once...\n\nAnd between these boring exchanges..... ACTION SCENE. I am willing to admit that unearned action scenes just simply don't do it for me. Some people do like that stuff, and its the least of my concerns.\n\nI feel like the show is holding me back from enjoying it at all times on purpose. This is a wild comparison, but it makes me feel like I'm watching Yellowstone at times. Lots of immature, irresponsible, and annoying characters.\n\nI don't mean to put people down for liking this show alot, but I just feel like it could be the best if done well.",

        "title": "Season 2 of Arcane is visually stunning, but both the worldbuilding and storytelling are disappointing.",
        "selftext": "\\*Unpopular opinion warning\\*\n\nCurrently Arcane is the second most popular TV series on both Netflix and IMDB, with a dazzling IMDB score of 9/10, and I'm struggling to find negative reviews on mainstream forums - which really surprises me as Season 2 feels quite underwhelming to me.\n\nThe visual design and animation are still absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Some of them are even more breathtaking than the best frames in Season 1, which is an incredible achievement since Season 1 is already one of the most each-frame-a-paint shows I've ever watched.\n\nHowever, the disparity between the stunning art and the unconvincing worldbuilding, combined with the poor storytelling (especially in respect of Season 2) is equally staggering.\n\nBelow I'd like to elaborate (in a spoiler-free manner) on the major shortcomings preventing me from enjoying the show, despite its incredible visual achievement:\n\n**1. Mediocre worldbuilding**\n\nArcane's world is a mixture of steampunk and magic. However, the rules governing how this world operates - i.e., when magic comes into play and when normal physics prevail - are extremely unclear. The audience struggles to deduce, based on previous events in the show, whether a character will be severely harmed by an explosion or remain completely unscathed.\n\nAlso, the show fails to adequately depict the scale and operations of the various organizations and political entities that significantly impact the plot. The scheming and conflicts between these groups often feel either meaningless or ludicrous because the audience lacks a reliable way to determine each group's advantages, disadvantages, or the true extent of their capabilities.\n\nThis lack of clear underlying rules often obscures the stakes, making the plot or action scenes far less engaging. The audience cannot confidently assess whether legitimate danger or consequences are at hand, which renders character's survival, death or other development undeserved or unearned.\n\nIf this show were intended solely for a younger audience, then a somewhat disorganized fantacy world might be less of an issue. But it's apparent that the show takes itself very seriously, with ambitions to tackle adult themes and nuanced topics. From an adult's perspective, the most critical aspect of convincing worldbuilding is the presence of clear \"stake\", which must be grounded in a set of explicit or implied rules. Without consistent rules, all the consequences and developments become dubious and unengaging.\n\n**2. Horrendous storytelling**\n\nThere are far too many artificial dramas and tensions. Characters frequently argue with one aother for various nonsensical reasons, refusing to listen to even a single word of explanation from their counterparts. Their communication skills are unrealistically underdeveloped, making any tensions derived from such poor communication initially laughable, but later tiring and infuriating.\n\nIf these dramas were merely filler, they might be more tolerable. Unfortunately, these conflicts - whether infuratingly juvenile or jaw-droppingly asinine - often have a significant impact and major consequences on the plot, making any subsequent story and character developments stemming from these events unconvincing and eye-roll-inducing.\n\nAlso, its quite obvious that the director often priortizes creating visually stunning scenes over crafting a plausible story. Many incredibly well-drawn frames are the direct result of unbelievably foolish decisions or physically impossible manuveur. I frequently find myself quesitoning the integrity of Arcane's story and characters, wondering whether such developments make any sense or if they are simply director's attempt to create yet another wallpaper-worth piece of art.\n\n\\---\n\nWithout spoilers, the overall scale of the major conflict escalates significantly in the later episodes, particularly in the second half of Season 2. Sadly, even at the grand finale of Season 2, I found myself completely unable to care about any of the characters' fate. The issue is that, whenever I try to care, I immediately start questioning all the nonsensical decisions these characters have made to reach the current plot point. Eventually I just stopped caring altogether. Without engaging with the story, those beautiful frames feel meaningless and at times even exhausting.\n\nOverall, my score for this season is 5/10, a far cry from the general sentiment currently shared by most viewers, it seems. I would only recommend this show to those who love League of Legend's universe and are genuinely interested in exploring its lore further, or to those who can be entertained by a show solely for its visual design. The writing of Season 2 should be taught as a cautionary lesson in storytelling classes.",

        "selftext": "How do I set original audio with subtitles to be automatic on netflix? Whenever I have set a show to be in original audio with english subtitles in the past, it always automatically had the subsequent episodes of the show with the same setting. I never had to change it, and other shows would even have the same setting. I have rarely had to touch the language settings after that. \nRecently, I began watching a new show and found that it would be dubbed automatically no matter how many times I change it. The next episode plays and it's back to dub. Is there something that I can do to ensure that the sub will be the default option on every show? I watch all shows in all languages with subtitles as I have trouble understanding just audio, even in languages that I speak, and it's quite annoying if this is something I'm going to have to constantly do for every episode. Any tips or if anyone knows if this is a new thing netflix does? Thanks!",

While I get he‚Äôs not supposed to ultimately be sinister, it‚Äôs impossible to not see the red flags that any sane woman alone at night in a car with him would not have waving in her face furiously. \n\nThe conversation is interesting and not dissimilar from some I have had in my many (mostly Uber) rides with a driver. I generally prefer dead silence, but if the ride is longer than 30 or 45 minutes it‚Äôs almost impossible to avoid. \n\nIn my experience through a variety of avenues, guys that tend to be this blunt and aggressively open right off the bat end up having not great intentions. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúfly off the handle‚Äù type that expects some result that if it does not go right to plan it‚Äôs the nuclear option. \n\nThe movie is ok, the scenario is hard to keep realistic in your head and the casting is bad. Someone like Ruffalo or Renner would have been far more palatable because, you know, they are actually middle aged and not 60+ year old men with sexual violence histories in real life. \n\nWatchable but not award worthy by any means.

Or at the very least they knew that Morgan‚Äôs presence would stir up drama. This event was an important rite of passage for the teenage niece and should have been a time for the family to focus on her. It was not about Morgan or her drama. It was not about Joanna or her drama. \n\nJoanna crashes Noah‚Äôs sermon unannounced (place of work) and is pissed she has to wait 15 minutes for him. He did his absolute best to rush out of there, but by the time he finds Joanna, she has already had her sister show up to bitch and *rescue* her. Maybe this isn‚Äôt narcissistic as much as a weird combo of needy, insecure and demanding. \n\nYes, Joanna confessed to going through the private box. But she failed to mention that it wasn‚Äôt just her snooping, but she was with her mom and her sister, all of them sitting around mocking Rebecca and laughing and making a show out of looking through somebody‚Äôs private belongings. That is more than just letting insecurities get the best of her, this came across as a symptom of a pathological lack of empathy and a casual disregard for personal boundaries, two signs of narcissism. \n\nIn the ick episode, Joanna leaves Noah alone with her nutty parents because she gets the ick. When you are introducing a new dating partner to your family, your role is to make that person feel comfortable around all these new people and support them. But she disappears, leaving him to wonder what the hell happened and then he eventually finds her out by the pool, where she‚Äôs in some sort of crisis about his blazer. If someone I was newly seeing did that to me, I‚Äôm sorry, but there‚Äôd be some boundaries drawn. \n\nThis last example is a bit harder to explain, but I‚Äôll try. Why was Morgan completely morally expunged once Joanna finds out she had ‚Äútold the truth‚Äù about what Rebecca had told her at the bar? Morgan‚Äôs behavior itself was callous and cruel. That is what should have been addressed. \n\nObviously characters shouldn‚Äôt be perfect, but the lack of awareness from the writers is what bothered me. They seemed to think that Morgan and Joanna were the quirky, sassy, loveable kind of flawed, not like an untreated personality disorder kind of flawed. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt give a shit, except for the fact that I just keep hearing about what an emotionally aware show this is, how healthy the relationship is, how much people identify with Joanna. I feel alone in this and so I thought I‚Äôd throw it out there to see if anyone feels the same way. ",

New allegiances must be made, each one a threat to his principles. Eventually Don Fabrizio is faced with an impossible choice. He has the power to engineer a marriage, between the rich and beautiful Angelica and his nephew Tancredi, that could secure his family‚Äôs legacy but, doing so would break his favorite daughter, Concetta‚Äôs heart. The series will be a modern exploration of timeless themes ‚Äî power, love, and the cost of progress.\n\nDIRECTOR: Tom Shankland, Giuseppe Capotondi, Laura Luchetti  \nWRITER: Richard Warlow, Benji Walters  \nBASED ON THE BOOK: The Leopard (Original Title: Il Gattopardo) by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\n\nKEY CAST: Kim Rossi Stuart, Benedetta Porcaroli, Deva Cassel, Saul Nanni\n\nTEASER: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DS9ERfLjk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DS9ERfLjk)",

        "title": "Looking for a show to watch? List of 5 of the best shows I have seen",
        "selftext": "People around me tell me that I give the best recommendations for shows and movies. You can basically be sure that whatever I recommend to you will not be in vain, and you'll likely share similar feelings to mine. I take a lot of pride in the fact that people respect the recommendations I give, along with the thoughts I share about a show or film. So, I refuse to do anything that might jeopardize that. Below is a list of shows (in no particular order) that I hold in the same regard as *Breaking Bad* (not all of the recommendations I give right now will have similar plots to *Breaking Bad*, such as drug dealing or gangs, but some will). Also, I am FAR FROM a good writer. So my writing may be a bit sloppy, or bland... but just trust me that these are some of the best shows you can watch. Each of them had a similar factor. I got extremely in to them to the point I would stand up, cry, or talk to the TV; and I basically watched most of them in a few sittings if not one alone. You will won't be bored for a while if you go through this list and watch each one. Here we go though!\n\n1. **Snowfall** 8/10 A solid show. It starts off feeling a bit cheesy with the acting and something about Franklin felt goofy to me at the start. However, the character development is outstanding, and the actors seem to find their footing as the show progresses. Take my criticism with a grain of salt because the show is definitely not a slow burn. It starts strong and captivating, only continuing to get better (until season 4).\n2. **3%** 9.5/10 A phenomenal show, truly a hidden gem, and in my opinion, the king of hidden gems. If a show truly deserves a 10/10 rating, this is one of the few that comes close. Some of the best acting I‚Äôve ever seen, with exceptional character development. I became so attached to some characters and truly despised others. What makes the show unique is that there isn‚Äôt a clear \"good guy/bad guy\" dynamic. While the show guides you toward who you‚Äôre supposed to root for, you can still choose your own \"home team\" without having your experience ruined. The show excels in its realism‚Äîreal in the way people react to events and situations. It provides a genuine depiction of what the world could be like, even in its dystopian setting. There isn't much \"evil\"; instead, you see people doing what they think is right, even if others view their actions as evil. I watched it in its original Portuguese because the dubbed English version didn‚Äôt do justice to the actors' performances‚Äîand frankly, it was poorly done, as most English dubs are. The show is filled with twists and turns, and it's almost never predictable. An incredible mind-bender of a show.\n3. **Ozark** 8/10 Another strong show. For some reason, I tried starting it about four times before I finally got into it‚ÄîI can't remember why. This show excels in almost all aspects: plot, acting, character development, and twists that are far from predictable. The pacing is smooth, and the plot is captivating. There are moments where you notice something but don‚Äôt think much of it, only to realize how pivotal it was 30 episodes later. I love shows with well-written foreshadowing, and *Ozark* is one of them.\n4. **Attack on Titan** 9.5/10 I understand not everyone is into anime, but I truly believe anyone can watch *Attack on Titan* and love it. In my opinion, it‚Äôs one of (if not *the*) greatest stories ever told. It doesn‚Äôt rely on typical anime clich√©s like over-the-top humor or fan service. The acting is great (both the sub and dub, although the sub is infinitely better), and it feels like regular TV‚Äîdespite being animated. The first episode grabs your attention in a huge way. While the show might seem a bit slow after that, be patient‚Äîthe first season is just laying the foundation. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a slow burn, but the first season is one of the less captivating ones. Once you reach the middle of the third season, nearly every episode has you on the edge of your seat. Not many shows can make me stand up or talk to the TV, but *Attack on Titan* did it repeatedly. It‚Äôs one of the most well-written shows of all time, with incredible foreshadowing, mind-blowing twists, and unforgettable characters. It explores the gray areas of good and evil in a way few shows do. The second half of the series is almost a new show, yet it still feels like the same one. It's hard to explain, but you‚Äôll understand if you watch it. This show has everything to be peak fiction‚Äînothing is missing. The ending was set from the very beginning, which is rare in storytelling. Every storyline and loose end is tied up in a way that‚Äôs incredibly satisfying. I cried multiple times and had my mind blown on more than one occasion. SO many twists. A perfect show.\n5. **White Lotus** 8.5/10 Another hit. I don‚Äôt typically enjoy comedies or shows that try too hard to be funny (not that I‚Äôd call *White Lotus* a comedy), because more often than not, I find them forced and unfunny. But this show had me laughing on several occasions. It doesn't let the humorous moments overshadow the overall tone of the show, nor does it detract from its urgency or seriousness. The show portrays society and the human psyche in a way that feels incredibly real. Throughout, you feel as though you‚Äôre watching a story that could happen in real life, even though the events are outrageous. The characters' reactions to events make sense, and I found myself comparing them to people I know. The acting is excellent, and each character feels authentic. At times, I was amazed at how much they resembled real people‚Äînot in appearance, but in their actions. It‚Äôs over the top at times, but never to the point where it feels unreal. A remarkable show.",

Tried to Google how to enable or disable but just found people with the same question as me.  In Youtube and a couple of websites, it says that to \"reduce animation effects when navigating on tv\" to put a check mark in the empty box. That seems pretty straight forward.  But in my account, under my profile, it says \"TV animation effects\" and under \"Reduce motion transitions\"  At the right side there is no box for a check mark, but a toggle, that is either gray with a minus \"-\" sign or if clicked again, it turns blue with a check mark sign.   Does the check mark still means that transitions are reduced, or since is blue with the checkmark that transitions are actually enabled and can be seen?",

Big mistake, apparently, because after making that change one time, every single movie or show that I start has portuguese audio and subtitles, and I have to change it back to english. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe PS5 app doesn't have any \"default language\" settings that I can find, aside from one on the show page that seems to be specific to that show. Of course, changing this to english doesn't stick - every time I come back to a show it has been changed back to portuguese.\n\nMy phone app does have a \"Manage Profiles\" option which allows me to select a language. I changed this to english. In fact, I have changed it to english several times over the last few days, and it keeps changing itself back to portuguese.\n\nThe \"Manage Profiles\" option on the netflix website also has a language option, though this appears to impact the menus rather than the in-show audio. This has been english all along and has not changed.\n\nI have tried logging out and logging back in. I have deleted the app from my devices and redownloaded it. I have logged out of ALL devices and changed everything I could back to english. Nothing changes. On every device, everything always defaults back to portuguese. It's driving me insane.\n\nHas anyone else had a problem like this? Am I missing a hidden setting somewhere? Or do I just have to accept my fate and learn portuguese to continue using Netflix?\n\nEDIT: after some more experimentation I have managed to get to a place where movies play in english, but shows still play in portuguese. This makes even less sense to me, but I guess it's a slight improvement?",

Let‚Äôs dive into why this show was pure peak and why Netflix really owes us a Season 3.\n\nFirst up, Marco and Jingim‚Äôs dynamic was one for the ages. I mean, c‚Äômon‚ÄîMarco, the Italian outsider, and Jingim, the heir to the Khanate? It wasn‚Äôt just a classic ‚Äúbuddies who can‚Äôt stand each other‚Äù thing; it was like watching two people who knew they had to learn from each other to survive. Marco‚Äôs worldview and knowledge from the West gave Jingim a different perspective, and vice versa. But it wasn‚Äôt some sappy bromance‚Äîthey constantly had that ‚Äúare we enemies or are we brothers?‚Äù vibe. Watching their grudging respect evolve was actually satisfying AF.\n\nThen we had Byamba, Kublai‚Äôs other son, who was a straight-up wild card. Byamba was that guy who could‚Äôve gone either way‚Äîtotally loyal one minute, ready to throw it all away the next. He‚Äôs got Kublai‚Äôs blood, but he‚Äôs way more rebellious and has no interest in all the traditional rules that Jingim is bound by. His interactions with Marco had this ‚Äúunlikely allies‚Äù energy, like they both understood what it felt like to be outsiders, even if for different reasons. Honestly, Marco kind of needed both of these relationships to survive Kublai‚Äôs court; Jingim taught him loyalty, and Byamba taught him adaptability.\n\nAlso, let‚Äôs talk Kublai Khan. This guy wasn‚Äôt just a brutal conqueror; he was a super complex ruler who respected Marco but also low-key saw him as a threat. I mean, that relationship? Tense. Kublai was like, ‚ÄúI could kill you in a heartbeat, but hey, you‚Äôre kind of useful.‚Äù He was layered, not just some caricature of a leader, which made his scenes all the more intense. Marco Polo didn‚Äôt shy away from showing how every decision Kublai made was about holding onto power, balancing loyalty, and maintaining family connections. He was ruthless, sure, but relatable? Weirdly, yes. By Season 2, I was more invested in his life than Marco‚Äôs half the time.\n\nAnd can we talk about Hundred Eyes? This man was easily one of the greatest mentors in any series. His wisdom, the way he balanced loyalty and his own sense of honor‚Äîit was all just legendary. He even got his own spin-off episode, which just proved how strong his character was. That spin-off was so good it felt like a teaser, but then‚Ä¶nothing. Like, c‚Äômon Netflix, you gave us a taste, and then left us high and dry. There‚Äôs so much more we could‚Äôve explored with him and his relationship with Marco and the whole ‚Äúwise mentor‚Äù dynamic that made us care so much.\n\nThe series had serious potential for a Season 3. They left so many threads open! There was Marco‚Äôs return to Italy still looming, and the impact his years in the East would‚Äôve had on him and, honestly, on Europe. Plus, the romance, political drama, the family feuds, and literal battles‚Äîit was like we were on the brink of watching the world change. We could‚Äôve seen Jingim stepping up, Marco finding himself in his ‚Äúreal home‚Äù of the Khanate, Byamba stirring the pot in his own rebellious way, and Kublai facing enemies on all sides, both foreign and family. Don‚Äôt tell me Netflix doesn‚Äôt see the potential here‚Äîlike, we all saw it!\n\nLook, if Netflix can greenlight five seasons of Emily in Paris, they can give us one more of Marco Polo. The fans are still here. Just scroll through the subreddits, the YouTube comments, the tweets‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs STILL talking about it. Imagine the hype if they announced Season 3, how they could bring back that mix of historical drama, action, and stunning visuals (shoutout to those Mongolia scenes, BTW).\n\nIn conclusion, if you‚Äôre listening, Netflix: Marco Polo was peak TV. The show deserves a conclusion, the fans deserve closure, and honestly, we all deserve to see Kublai, Marco, Byamba, Jingim, and Hundred Eyes in action one last time. Bring it back for the culture.",

While Nunes showed remarkable courage by lasting the entire bout, Goyat's showboating and unnecessary theatrics overshadowed what could have been a more dignified victory. The disparity in skill levels was evident, and Goyat could have ended things much earlier.\n\n## Ramos vs. Barrios: Undercard Steals the Show\nThe second bout between Ramos and Barrios emerged as a genuine crowd-pleaser. This matchup exemplified everything fans love about boxing ‚Äì two evenly matched fighters trading blows in a contest that kept spectators on their feet throughout. The bout's outcome remained uncertain until the final bell, delivering the kind of excitement that makes boxing great.\n\n## Taylor vs. Serrano: Netflix's Production Shines\nThe Taylor-Serrano rematch showcased Netflix's potential in boxing broadcasts. The unfiltered coverage, particularly the close-up shots of battle damage, brought viewers uncommonly close to the action. Serrano's determination, fighting through a significant cut, demonstrated the heart and grit that defines the sport. This match alone made the entire event worthwhile.\n\n## Main Event: Tyson vs. Paul\nThe highly anticipated main event between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul fell short of expectations. Paul employed a strategic approach, effectively avoiding Tyson's power shots, but the match lacked the impact fans anticipated. While Paul's game plan proved successful, it's becoming evident that he needs to face opponents in his own weight class and experience level. The pattern of carefully selected matchups continues to raise questions about the legitimacy of his career progression.\n\n## Netflix's Boxing Future\nThis event highlighted Netflix's potential in the boxing world. The streaming platform could revolutionize boxing broadcasting by introducing either a weekly Friday night fight card or reviving the spirit of classic ABC Sports' Saturday afternoon programming. If they can consistently deliver undercards of this caliber, they could establish themselves as a major player in boxing broadcasting.\n\nThe value proposition is clear: delivering high-quality boxing content through an existing subscription service represents a significant win for fight fans. If Netflix maintains this level of production quality and match-making (particularly for undercard bouts), they could carve out a meaningful niche in combat sports broadcasting.",

Which makes no sense because then she wouldn‚Äôt have found his Time Machine. \n\nAnyone else have any thoughts about how this could work? Overall I did enjoy the movie (the soundtrack was the best part) and I knew it was going to be cheesy going in. ",

This is so infuriating i am really thinking about writing a formal complaint.\n\nAnyone else has this problem?",

It's clear that there was oversight in this aspect and Netflix underestimated the shear demand of live streaming. They need to use dedicate servers for this!!!!\n\n- Rosie Perez and Cedric the Entertainer. Cedric's funny even though he stole Kat's joke. Cedric is absolutely unfit to be calling a damn boxing event. Cedric's HORRIBLE and provides no substance.  Snoop was waaaay more entertaining when he called Jakes fight some years ago. Rosie is bland and doesn't truly know boxing beyond her school fights. It's as of Netflix just wrote a check to someone who needed money.\n\n- Disorganization. While I found Serrano' manager's comments hilarious, it was a bit uncalled for from a professional perspective. It honestly showed how much of a shit show this was and it's all on Netflix. \n\n- Future subscriptions. There is no doubt Netflix will eventually add a tier for live streaming and it will be expensive as shit. Consider their contract with NFL, WWE, and their own shows. It will absolutely suck and cost you a premium.\n\nIt's clearly an event out on for casuals and that's fine but ffs don't cut corners. We pay good money already and I'm still pissed you raised the subscription from the 9.99 Netflix so you fucking owe us!!!",

For context, I‚Äôm on a 1-gig fiber connection, which is usually extremely reliable and rarely gives me any trouble. However, I‚Äôve found myself needing to refresh the stream on my PC several times to keep it running smoothly.\n\nWhile this isn‚Äôt a major issue for me personally, as refreshing on a computer is fairly quick and easy, I can‚Äôt help but think about viewers at home who might be watching the stream on their TVs. For those individuals, I imagine it could be quite inconvenient to have to interrupt their viewing experience, potentially get up, and troubleshoot or restart the stream multiple times.\n\nI wanted to bring this up not only to see if others are encountering similar problems but also in case this might be an issue worth investigating further on the technical side. If there‚Äôs a broader issue, it might be worth addressing sooner rather than later to ensure a seamless viewing experience for everyone.\n\nLooking forward to hearing if anyone else has noticed this or has insights to share.\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "It feels like **\"Hot Frosty\"** officially kicked off Netflix's *pseudo-Hallmark Christmas Movies* onslaught this year.  It's kind of a high-concept rom-com Christmas movie, basically \"what if *Frosty the Snowman* happened for a widower + Frosty is mad chiseled?\".\n\nOverall, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I thought I would, so if you haven't seen it yet, temper your expectations.  Easily, Dustin Milligan is the standout.  I always liked him from Schitt's Creek, but he was just great in this role, balancing sweet/fish-out-of-water with sincere while pulling off the comedy aspects.  His interaction with Joe Lo Truglio was maybe my favorite part of the movie (probably tied with the 'pushing the woman's car' bit while shirtless + following scenes with the ladies friends were up there).\n\nMy biggest issue with the movie is unfortunately Lacey Chabert (as \"Kathy\").  I'll be honest, I haven't watched most of her Hallmark releases, but here, I just found her to be a surprisingly weak lead for what was a decently stacked cast.  The major problem is that for a movie called \"Hot Frosty\", I didn't feel any *heat* between Kathy and \"Jack\" (the snowman come to life).  Their lack of chemistry really sunk what could have been a much stronger rom-com (*see* **Nobody Wants This** for an example of rom-com leads with both romantic and comedic chemistry).  As a result, I found that my favorite parts of the movie were all scenes *without* her and I was never rooting for them to get together.\n\nNot as big a problem, but I really didn't like what they did for Craig Robinson as the antagonist sheriff.  He just came off as way too unlikable and not all that funny.  I think the character could have been written in a different way to still fulfill that role, but in a funnier/more enjoyable way.\n\nOn the other end of things, it took me a second to recognize Lauren Holly (I don't think I've seen her in much since the *Dumb and Dumber* days).  I was hoping for a reveal that >!her husband also started out as a snowman!<, but that never happened.  It's still my head-canon though.\n\nWhat we got was still enjoyable to a degree, but can't help feeling like this was a missed opportunity.  That said, I'm a 40+ dude, so not sure I'm the target audience haha.  Next on the list, hoping Lindsay Lohan's upcoming **\"Our Little Secret\"** ends up being a lot more fun!",

This is exactly what happened with HBO /Max before we cancelled it. I'm thinking about taking this staple service and putting it on the rotation of on for a month off for 11.\n\nI have no interest in reality, sitcom, or live programming. \n\nWhat does my family like? Witty, adventure, and scifi/fantasy.

These both look like they were probably low budget (no special effects dominating the screen), though maybe the talent cost some money. The thing that really marks these shows as interesting is that they have good solid writing and story telling chops.\n\nOutside of stranger things, Netflix doesn't appear to know how to pick shows that are what most of us would call good.

It was a limited series (one season) about a crime/psychological mystery thriller with a detective who was hunting a serial killer. I remember him with brown hair and kind of looked like the actor who plays Kronk? He was friends or became friends with this other middle age man with blonde hair (I see his face so vividly but do NOT know where he‚Äôs from). \nI‚Äôm pretty sure the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù the detective made was actually the father or step father of this girl who was killed by the serial killer. There‚Äôs a plot twist at the end that I don‚Äôt want to say, but the show was so damn good. \nI think they took it off Netflix, I can‚Äôt find it. I think the title was like one word? Something really unexpected idk it might have started with an S. \n\nPLEASE HELP ME IVE BEEN GOOGLING FOR HOURS AND GOT NOTHING",

Just to rule out network issues on my side, I upgraded to a 750 Mbps plan and receive a steady 940 Mbps via Ethernet, so speed limitations aren't a factor here.\n\nDoes anyone else see the same with *Alita* or other Netflix titles? If you have access to Netflix's \"Stats for Nerds\" menu, it'd be interesting to compare results!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3anw95aatm0e1.png?width=1938&format=png&auto=webp&s=2708dc9676d68a801737675e500530b44f344b14",

It's just a shower thought from the general vibes I'm getting from these stories. \n\nAvatar and Lord of The Rings are very black and white and fairly easy to digest for children. Arcane and Game of Thrones are much more complex and grey when it comes to good and bad, and definitely much more grown up in their tone too. Plus Arcane and ATLA are both beautifully animated original shows. LOTR and GoT obviously have a very similar fantasy setting and they are both based on books too. When it comes to the setting though, I feel like Arcane is closer to Avatar: LoK than to ATLA. But I will let that one slide.",

Idk who the directors were behind this past seasons but they def have to get fired. not only did it feel so chaotic and disjointed, it also just full on transformed from a show about a friend group to  a fantasy about treasure hunters. not only that but the fact that there was some type of cliffhanger every 10 seconds shows how completly unrealistic this plot was. Especially w that cop who's somehow the town only working officer, investigator, auctioneer, and pathologist. like it genuinely hurts me at the fact that they ruined an actual good show and even though I still had hope after season 3 now its just completely trash. smh",

The 2024 one where now the parents have lost both their daughter\n\n2. One that Summer stays alive and has a life with Lucy, which keep in mind now a security guard is now dead along with the other 2 of summer friends.\n\n3. A whole separate time line when Lucy killed future Quinn, aka the time line we seen when Lucy killed Quinn in the parking garage. I‚Äôm supposing when she went back to her house and seen summer is alive and they (Summer and the parents) clearly don‚Äôt recognize her bc summer lived so therefore no Lucy\n\n4. The timeline where everyone lives (summer and her friends) and Quinn turns bad aka going to the past to kill summer and her friends. So prior to him going back in time there is a universe where every single one of the friends live and Quinn just disappears.\n\nThis is all so confusing, mainly the part that messes me up is how Lucy is even able to have a life in the 2003 time line with Summer.

        "selftext": "This show has overplayed its hand. It's just no longer good. And I say this as a fan. I loved the first 3 seasons but it's time to call it a day. \n\nAll the characters have become caricatures of themselves. A shell. Like we get it. Pope is worried about his future and is angsty about all the pressure on him. JJ is a screw up who's throwing his life away but its not his fault, his dad was abusive. Jon B and Sara are in love. But oh wait, Topper is a threat to their relationship and somehow still a jerk after 3 separate redemption arcs that didn't stick. That Rafe guy is Craaaaazy. Oh my godd Kiaras parents are so gonna ground her again. Here comes Shoupe, the good hearted cop who's hands are always tied by higher ups and never believes the kids despite them always being right. *swampy adventure treasure hunt with dangerous men trying to kill them enues, but dont worry, this Rag tag group of 150 pound uneducated teenagers will always find a way to get the drop on trained hitmen*\n\nThey have discovered 3 separate priceless treasures and have *NO* money.  And nothing but a raggedy dock shop to show for it and it's already in danger. And this is the crux of the treasure hunter genre with sequels. It's why they never made a National Treasure 3. Because for starters. Treasure hunting is extremely dangerous and often unfruitful. So if you have an ungodly amount of money from all the treasure you've found, you're unlikely to keep risking it unless you've just developed some like, sick obsession. But at the end of the day. Audiences don't connect with rich people making themselves richer. Also when youre rich you have a bunch of resources that take the fun out of treasure hunting. So in order to keep the characters hunting for treasure the author needs to keep the treasure hunters poor. So what does the author do? They have somebody steal the treasure. But the problem therein lies that the story ceases to be about chasing clues for a long lost treasure and instead just becomes a fight to the death for money. So they have the treasure reveal an even bigger treasure or the absolute worst thing is when they make the characters EXTEMELY stupid with their money and lose it all (looking at you JJ). But even so, you can only do all this so many times before it becomes absurd and redundant. \n\nDon't get me wrong it's kinda poetic to see each character have some old unknown family ties to a treasure. But the treasure is no longer tied to the Royal Merchant. And thats the sad part is I thought the first 3 seasons were good. And minus the cliffhangers for season 4 I think the end of season 3 would be the perfect send off point for the story. The royal merchant leads them to the cross of Santo Domingo which leads them to el Dorado. The story that begins with Cameron ward killing John sr ends with both of them dying. It wrapped everything up nearly in a bow. \n\nThe story now lacks vision and direction. The actors all hate eachother now and it bleeds through. And it got so bad that they broke their formula and actually killed off a main character. But as predictable as this story has become I can only assume they are gonna slide Rafe over into JJs role as the wild card of their group. And just to keep things nice and symmetrical I bet they'll even spark a romance between Kiara and Rafe. And since every great story still needs an antagonist, I can only assume Topper will fill that role solo now. And Sara's pregnancy? Slim chance that sticks. They will probably just have her miscarry. But on the slim chance she doesn't, im guessing timeskip into everyone being retired from treasure hunting and JB and Sara are parents but they get pulled back in when their baby gets kidnapped or threatened. IDK. There's not many options. All I do know is this show should have concluded with the 3rd season.",

YouTube looks normal, so I don't see why it'd be an issue with my TV. Issue isn't super vital to fix, I usually put on a show/YouTube video for background noise while I play video games on my other TV.

        "selftext": "Hi, I know most content is in 1080p anyway, but I am wondering if I should still get the 4k subscription since I do not know if the quality of the 1080p will also be downgraded as it is for the 4k subscription. But this I mean that the 4k content is heavily condensed and does that mean that they also condense 1080p subscription so it is even worse than 1080p? Basically, am I going to get decent 1080p content with a 1080p subscription or for good quality 1080p content I actually need to go with the 4k subscription instead since Netflix maybe condenses 1080p content on the 4k subscription less?",

I received a free month as it was back then without having to submit any payment information. At the end of that first free month, I went on a one-week vacation in Barcelona. During this vacation, I received a notification from Netflix that my complimentary month was ending so I had to add my payment details to continue my membership, which I did. At that time, I the Standard Plan cost the same in Spain as in Romania. I used my PayPal account to pay for the membership, by the way, so I didn't notice anything weird about it.\n\nFast forward six years, and today I got an email from Netflix telling me that they're increasing the price to 13.99 euros. As I don't usually pay much attention to my automatic subscriptions (I know, my bad!) the price sounded pretty high so I went to the Netflix Romania website where to my surprise, the Standard plan cost only 9.99 euros. So I was like, WTF!? Taking a look at my payment history I see that at least for the last few years, I've been paying 12.99 euros for the Standard Plan. While talking to support, they asked me if I live in Spain because all along I've been paying the cost for the Spanish Standard Plan. I told the support, that I live in Romania and haven't visited Spain since 2018. Of course, they told me there was nothing they couldn't do about it and that I should cancel my current plan and restart it again after it expires to switch to the Romanian price.\n\nOf course, I am partially to blame for this situation, but since Netflix can easily find multiple people abusing a single account, can't they figure out you have lived for the past 6 years in a country and paid the membership for another country? At least a notification or something, FFS.\n\nSo yeah, I'm canceling and never getting back! \"Thanks\", Netflix",

        "selftext": "Someone please help cause I swear I'm in some kind of Mandela effect. I am sure I watched either a TV episode, interview, or documentary online about this case a couple months ago before Sweet Bobby was released. It had way more details than Sweet Bobby did and was far more in-depth about the details of the case. It started out with her relationship with JJ before getting into details about Bobby (I think they might have used an alternative name to Bobby?). It didn't include any interviews with her family, and was just her telling story. It also didn't include an interview with Bobby and wife, or any photos of actual Bobby. It did include details about the intimacy they had over phone, and I think they showed a photo of her cousin and also sound clips she had from \"Bobby\". I'm banging my head against a wall trying to find out what the hell it was I watched but all I'm getting is Sweet Bobby. Does anyone recall seeing this or did I watch an alternate reality version of this show?",
