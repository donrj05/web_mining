Yoshiko (Satomi Tezuka) is an artist and her husband, Nobuo (Tomokazu Miura), is a hypnotist. Their son, Hajime (Maya Banno), has fallen in love with a girl at school, while his sister, Sachiko (Takahiro Sato), is seeing bizarre visions, usually her own gigantic doppelganger following her through town, a specter she's convinced will go away if only she can pull off a perfect backflip.”\n\n",

I'm on the lookout for body horror movies that not only have disturbing transformations and intense physical horror but also come with a strong story plot, similar to how Saw (2004) keeps you on edge with its mind games and twists.\n\nI’ve enjoyed films that balance disturbing body horror with intricate plots, especially where there’s a psychological angle involved, like The Fly or The Human Centipede, but I'm interested in films with a bit more complexity in the storyline. Any lesser-known or indie films in this genre would be highly appreciated.\n\n\n",

Taking a much needed break as a hospice nurse and would love to hear any of your suggestions for movies that are fun but not rom-coms or raunchy comedies. Original Sin or Sweet Home Alabama comes to mind as something with romance but also different from usual tropes. Doesn't have to necessarily be light hearted like Original Sin. Thanks a bunch!!",

I know they are treated as \"child movies\", but they feel more well-constructed than, let's say, Insideous or the Ouija movie - because the former ones do not depend only on this cheesy thing about killing everyone, jumpscares and a dog skull popping on your bathroom's mirror.\nAlso, the thing that they're bad because \"yeah, I'm a demon\" is also getting on my nerves. It's like they ran out of plots like 30 years ago.\nBtw, if this is not horror, please tell me what kind of movie I'm looking for. It can be anime as well.",

What superhero movie would you say is the most similar to Guardians of Galaxy? The comedy and plotline just went great together. Deadpool is another great one, I Only just saw Deadpool a week ago after watching Deadpool and Wolverine first and Liking that, what would you suggest would be the best one to go with next? I've seen the last 2 Avenger movies, Captain America 1. Logan. Iron man, probably 1 but idk really. Some X-Men (mostly the ones with James McCavoy) and I think Spiderman 1 with Tobey Maguire, I think that's about all lol. Thanks in advance for helping a newbie to this genre.",

I want the kind of movie with cheesy dialogue, unrealistic love stories, and a plot that’s as thin as a piece of tinsel, where every character feels like they’re reading straight off a script written by an over-caffeinated elf.\n\nEDIT: Thx guys! Seems like Hot Frosty is a leader. :)\n\nSo far, I’ve made some observations regarding this type of movie:\n\n* **Made in Canada, Vancouver.**\n* **Main male character:** Chris, who is either a prince or the son of Santa. He wears a green sweater and is a widower.\n* **Main female character:** Emily, his high school sweetheart. She loses her memory due to a blow to the head and gets amnesia during a winter festival. She wears a red sweater.\n* Emily leaves the big city and drives to a small town to inherit either a tree farm or a Bed and Breakfast. She is trying to sell it to get back together with her mean big-city businessman boyfriend but fails and stay in town forever.\n* Emily has a best friend co-worker who encourages her to embrace the Christmas spirit, but has zero backstory.\n* The movie features a gazebo where Emily dances.\n* The couple kissing under the mistletoe due to snowstorm in empty church or bakery and than they declare own love on town square to all people like maniacs.\n\nHope this all will be in movie :)",

The wife and I were content watching cheesy Christmas movies, and saw Netflix recommend her Christmas Wedding Planner and decided to casually give it a go. What I didn't realise is watching this movie was the equivalent to smoking a big pipe of crack, and it awoke something in us. For the remainder of the Christmas period, we were a pair of desperate addicts consuming a mountain of bad Christmas movies in a feeble attempt to scratch that itch, but to no avail.\n\nFor those who don't know, Christmas Wedding Planner is the most insane hallmark Christmas movie ever made. The sets look like they're out of a high-budget adult film, the acting is horrendous (eg there's a scene where the baker says someone will be over in 10 minutes, all the while looking at a non-existent watch on his wrist), there are heaps of awkward silences, but the crème de la crème is the ending. I won't spoil it, but it's so ridiculous that we were howling with shocked laughter.\n\nThis year, we need help from the experts. Does anyone have a Christmas romcom that they think can match or even beat Christmas Wedding Planner and help us scratch that itch? I will go to any length to meet my withdrawals. Thanks in advance!",

I wanted a few other ideas to toss around. Also, as a side note, the class is entirely latinx / hispanic, so I want to remain culturally sensitive and prolly not choose a film that doesnt feature a single brown person.

It’s a very deep Film that explores the idea of grief, loss and creation through a creative and philosophical concept. The film follows a bureaucrat that exists between the realms of the living and non existent who has nine days to pick between 5 unborn souls who should get to go on and live. I loved this film way more than I thought I would and I think it being released in 2020 is the driving cause of it not being talked about enough. Seriously if you like The Good Place by Micheal Schur or frankly any sort of existential philosophy you have to check this film out.",

While the game is def. lovecraftian horror in nature, I'm not necessarily interested in supernatural or horror stuff. What I would like is more akin to a suspenseful period drama set in somewhere between the 16th and 19th century. \n\nMovies that I really enjoyed and are something what I'm looking for: The Witch, Last Duel, Black '47, Name of the rose, Pale Blue Eyes, The Village and the anime Berserk. (plus a bunch of others I can't recall at the top of my head)\n\nI hope you can help me!\n\n",

Like there's a secret sauce that gives the feeling that any one of the characters could be killed at any moment. Despite the fact that there were 4 seasons, it felt like the show could have ended at any moment, either because of dire stakes or because the story plays a game of darts with the characters lives.\n\nAnyways are there any movies that you would feel the same way about? The closest thing that comes to mind for me are all of Tarantino movies like Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Bastards. I just saw Die Hard and that movie is way goofier it still gave me that kind of tension on a smaller scale.\n\nJust wanna add it doesn't have to be a movie where everyone/anyone dies. If you somehow know a movie that has that AoT like tension but it ends satisfying and everyone's OK, sounds like you could find a unicorn irl.",

It’s one of those situations where in hindsight I can acknowledge that she was not the best girlfriend and is probably not the person I had built her up to be in my head, but for whatever reason I just can’t seem to move on. I still deeply care about her and I keep waiting for her to come back, and the most frustrating part is that I’m not really sure why since I know deep down that I am better off without her. Anyways, given the background info that I have provided, does anybody have any recommendations for movies that might be able to aid me on my journey to moving on? Particularly romantic comedies, I want something that is going to make me laugh but will also be cathartic for me. Bonus points if the main character is a young adult male. Thanks!",

Or movies that highlight how American society places extreme cultural value on celebrating the holidays and how alienating and sad the season is to people who aren't on good terms with their families or can't spend time with them for whatever reason. Or even disgruntled retail worker has a breakdown during the holiday season and goes on a rampage! I want the movie to stay critical of Christmas and the characters who don't like Christmas don't have some kind of Grinch or Scrooge revelation that suddenly makes them full of Christmas spirit.\n\nIt doesn't have to be pessimistic!

        "selftext": "Hey guys. I am huge David Lynch fan. My favorite movie by him is Mulholland Drive, but I recently saw Inland Empire and I love it too. What I particularly like about the film is that it seems like it makes no sense for a majority of the film, but by the end it all comes together. I would say with Inland Empire, more so than with Mulholland Drive, I was still confused by the end, and needed to read up on what happened, but honestly there is nothing I love more than finishing a movie and still being absolutely clueless about what I just watched. I saw that someone else on this forum had asked for movies similar to Inland Empire, but most of the recommendations he got were foreign films. While I am open to foreign films, I prefer movies in English because I suffer from chronic depression and reading subtitles for a long movie can be difficult at times. Today, I plan on watching Berberian Sound Studio by Peter Strickland, which looks promising, but I would love to have a second movie planned to watch in the upcoming days as well. I look forward to hearing your recommendations. I hope everyone is having a great day. Thank you in advance.",

I am always open to dark movies but I’m mostly looking for some mind-bending films that are fun to watch (Coherence, Don’t Worry Darling, etc) Not necessarily comedy, but something that isn’t soul-crushing. I also really love sci-fi too and haven’t found many psychological sci-fi thrillers.\n\nAnyway yeah I’m trying to find some more niche psychological thrillers! Any suggestions are appreciated!",

Nights spent staring out of the window at the streetlights and the city slept. I watches some movies around that time which seemed to capture the spirit of that feeling, but I can't quite find that feeling anymore. I'm talking about things like Lost Highway and Requiem for a Dream, dark films with an almost dreamlike narrative which just captured a feeling of... I dunno, being trapped in the night.\n\nSome more recent films have come close to evoking that feeling, such as Only God Forgives, You were never really here... It's a feeling of ... maybe quiet threat, of things being not quite right, the feeling that the sun is always beyond the horizon.\n\nI appreciate that I am older now and as such I have changed as a person. But if anyone can recommend some films that come close to triggering that feeling, I'd be grateful.\n\n  \nI watched a trailer for \"Lost River\" which I'm going to check out. The trailer definitely caused the feeling to well up. Possibly the coimbination of the music and the scenes of... I guess people outstaying their welcome\n\n  \nThanks to all of you.",

Spoiler tags are your friend!  \n\n* Runtime is about 90 minutes so it doesn't feel like you have to give up a whole section of your day for it.  \n\n* It reminded me a lot of a Philip K. Dick novella with its premise, themes, and the way the story both meets and subverts your expectations as you go.  \n\n* The \"twist\" was set up nicely and quickly executed.  \n\n* Sam Rockwell carries the movie. Every other character could've been played by someone else with no change. Kevin Spacey's voice as Gertie the robot is good, and the physical acting for the robot is honestly phenomenal and elevated scenes (never thought I'd be praising the facial expressions of a robot).  \n\n* Other movies I've seen that give some of the same vibes (though obviously not going to be perfect comparisons): Event Horizon (1997), Solaris (2002, haven't seen the original), Europa Report (2013), Interstellar (2014), The Martian (2015), Annihilation (2018), Ad Astra (2019).  \n\n* Next on my watchlist for this kind of movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).  \n\nI think that's about it!

I’m pretty sure there are other examples, and especially ones where it’s the bad guy who’s keeping the hero in this « better world » to prevent him from striking back. \n\nThe congress or Wandavision kinda do that too, but it’s not exactly what I’m thinking about. I’m looking for alternative timelines, like « what could have been » if things went well. The idea is that it’s almost the same as the real world but where all the sad events of the main plot have not happened, everybody who’s dead in reality is alive here, the antagonist is a good guy, etc… (like in Arcane and Ghostland, or - even if it’s a bit different - the opposite of Back to the Future 2) \n\nAnd at one point it all vanishes, but it can be a good thing : the character will finally do what he has to do in reality and stop dreaming.

I loved everything about this film. Sorry, I am not that good at describing stuff. The filmography was good quality. Each scene was rich in details. The action and choreography was pretty good. I loved the opera fight scene. Good progression all around. ",
