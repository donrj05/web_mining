No other movie has made me feel the emotions I have watching interstellar from start to finish. The messages with his son and Murph on the ship, his dialog with Tars, the entire Tesseract scene, when he returns home, and so many more amazing scenes make this movie incredible. The Tesseract scene/connecting with murph is really my driving question, how the F did Nolan think of that? Honestly thankful for this movie 11/10 ",

So, let me get this straight: Daniel is just going to leave his kids—Anthony (who’s like 14) and Sam (who acts like she’s 14 and would literally fight a piece of paper if it annoyed her)—and go to Beijing with Jackie Chan for no apparent reason?\n\nYou’d think after almost losing everything in the karate war, Daniel would want to avoid teaching martial arts especially after learning about Mr. Miyagi past and how he killed someone\n\nSomehow, Daniel still has his car business, and he’s married to Amanda. Is Amanda really going to be like, “Oh sure, Daniel, go to Beijing and have fun! In fact, why not start another karate war in Beijing? If another kid dies, no big deal!” 🥹\n\nThis plot might barely make sense if it were Johnny going to Beijing—but even Johnny has a family now, so it still wouldn’t work.\n\nAccording to IMDB: “Daniel arrives in Beijing, where Mr. Han has been seeking him out. Han has a new protégé, Li Fong. The two mentors must collaborate to instruct Li Fong, but it remains to be seen if their instructional approaches will be compatible.”\n\nWhy does Daniel need to go to Beijing? Doesn’t he have enough to deal with back home? Like making  sure Chozen or Johnny doesn’t run into a building wearing a double cheeked out in a thong?\n\nLike I still get bully Vibes from Anthony \n\nYou gonna let Anthony roam around free while he bullies another kid into kicking his ass?\n\nDaniel has students to teach (if they even still want to do karate after everything that’s happened). Why does Li Fong even matter to Daniel? Why does Mr Han matter to Daniel?\nThis just sounds like a movie version of Daniel and Johnny’s rivalry all over again. What do they mean by “if their instructional approaches are compatible”?\n\nWhy would Daniel want to go through another situation like the one with Johnny?\n\nOr hell this man was put into a Dog Cage\n\nYou think he would wanna have a few years off to be a normal person. But no apparently not \n\nJust wanna know if this pre Cobra Kai or did Daniel straight up just leave everyone to train this kid ",

Over the past seven years, I've been working on a unique project: creating lists of challenging words and idioms from films and TV shows, complete with their definitions, to help English learners. I share these lists online for anyone to use.\n\nRecently, I completed [a vocabulary list for films directed, written, and produced by Christopher Nolan](https://filmvocab.wordpress.com/2024/01/08/christopher-nolan/) ([direct link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13bffVmTO7gT65JQhM0Rjjq2eGsOL8Kjd/view?usp=sharing)). Since many people have found these lists helpful--and because I've been spending so much time on them--last year, I launched a [dedicated blog](https://filmvocab.wordpress.com/) to compile all the vocabulary lists I’ve created so far.\n\nThe collection includes a range of shows, from [The X-Files](https://filmvocab.wordpress.com/2016/11/28/the-x-files/) to [Friends](https://filmvocab.wordpress.com/2024/11/09/friends-vocabulary-for-learners-of-english/).

It feels the entire movie industry has declined to point where very little of importance seems to surface. Not zero, but defintely a lot less.\n\nTo me it seems like almost all of the money goes into tv series production. How did we get here? Is it a push from the studies / content or plattform owners because the business case is just better that way? Hooking people with series so they feel compelled to continue with all the netflixes, hbos, disneys etc? I mean it's not difficult to understand that, but is it the sole reason?\n\nI don't have anything against tv series, of course a lot of them are really good. But cant they co-exist with movies, or it does not work that way? \n\nSeems like we are in a death spiral? Because less resources, less appetite for risk, therefore more \"safe\" releases like the endless marvel and now stat wars, reboots etc. \n\nCan this trend be reversed or is this just to accept and continue the dig in the back catalogue?  \n",

        "title": "I have a new found appreciation for Frozen after rewatching it recently.",
        "selftext": "I have a new found appreciation for Frozen after rewatching it today.\n\nSo today I decided to rewatch Frozen, a movie, that ive had a love/hate relationship for a while now. When it first came out, I had literally zero interest, and the fact that it got WAY too overblown in hype just made it even worse for me, to the point where i did not bother watching it when it first came out, and i wrote it off as bad (or at the very least, Mid) and overrated, but then in 2018, my GF at the time made me watch it in her preparation for the sequel....i didn't like it then, but then I rewatched in 2023 and...I thought it was just okay, not good, not bad, but fine.\n\nBut, I rewatched today, and I can safely say....I finally get it. I finally understand the love. The movie, is great, still not a 10/10 masterpiece, I'll explain why in a little bit, but I have such a new found appreciation for the movie now. \n\nThe songs are great, the characters are (for the most part) very well written and three dimensional, especially Anna and Elsa, Anna and Elsa's sisterly relationship and bond is the core of this movie and its beautiful, Anna, while maybe nowhere near the same level as Rapunzel for me, is still one of the best modern Disney heroines in a film, and Elsa, while I didn't like at first, thanks to this rewatch, she has grown on me as a character (also, both girls are very attractive), the visuals are breathtaking, the score is phenomenal, Sven and Olaf are genuinely funny, also the Yoo-Woo Guy is everything, this is truly a situation where sometimes giving a movie another and a reevaluation is never a bad thing. \n\nBut why? Why do I have such a new found appreciation for it now? Well, I think there is 2 key reasons.\n\n1. The Sequel. Even before my new found appreciation for the first film, I still thought the sequel was trash. To the point where I unironically think Wish 2023 is a better movie then Frozen 2...I'm serious, atleast Wish is fun to make fun of how bad it is, Frozen 2 on the other hand, is not, it's miserable. Not only that, but there is a reason I gave the sequel the nickname \"Character Assassination: The Movie\" because it takes everything beautiful about the first one, and takes a massive dump on it, by regressing Elsa as a character, introducing the Northuldra and a half-baked and poorly done message about Indigenous oppression just to justify said character regression, flanderizes Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf, completely destroys the whole point and theme of the first one, don't even get me started on the Spirit crap again, it's no wonder barely anyone besides me is willing to give the third and fourth film a chance. However if there is one thing I will give the sequel, is that it made me love and appreciate the first one, and give it a reevaluation.\n\n2. My current life position: I'll be honest, my life hasn't been the best, as of late, I was forced to move back home to Ottawa, which is not a bad thing, persay, but I lived in London Ontario for a year, and I made so many friends and memories, that when I was forced to move back because of my parents job promotion (whom I live with, I won't say which parent it is, don't want to get too personal) I was forced to leave that all behind. Just like how Elsa was forced to leave her sister behind, Anna, in order to protect, but also made me disconnect with my brother, because I saw how much better his life seemed to be, and we drifted apart when I first moved back, just like how Elsa and Anna drifted apart after they were separated, but after watching the film again, it made me appreciate not only my new surroundings, and appreciate my brother again, but also made me appreciate the sisterly bond even more. Because in the end it doesn't matter how your life has been, your family will always be there for you, and will always have your back, no matter what, and you don't have to deal with stuff alone. Which I think is a beautiful message. Especially during the holiday season (on top of the message of embracing who you are and not being afraid of your true self).\n\nIt's not a flawless film, I still feel like the parents could've done more to help there daugther, instead of just locking her away, I still don't buy the romance between Anna and Kristoff, personally, I would've preferred if they remained friends, and yeah....Hans sucks as a villain. Not only does the twist feel unearned and not properly built up, but also, I realized, he's a rip-off of Syndrome from the Incredibles. \n\nLike, his plan is to kill Elsa and make himself look like the hero, that's just syndrome from the Incredibles, Hans is the cheap copy. Or if your a Marvel nerd, the inferior version of Mysterio from FFH. Personally, I think the Duke of Weaseltown should've been the clear-cut sole main antagonist of the movie. Or do what Fanscription did and have the ice blast to Anna's heart actually turn her dark in the end, which, I think would've slightly more interesting.\n\nBut, oh well, seeing Anna Deck Hans was still pretty funny though. Also, I could do without Fixer Upper. But overall, though, yeah, I have a new found appreciation for this film, it deserves all the hype and recognition it has gotten over the years, and while I still think Tangled is the better (also, Rapunzel and Flynn Rider was also everything), Frozen still very much now officially, deserves, a 9/10.",

Or am I as the average viewer with no musical background, just fooled into believing I'm not capable of hearing the subtle mistakes and thereby tricked into believing JK is correct when he actually isn't? Because that changes his character. Is he just yelling and intimidating because he thinks it'll make them better even though they're already flawless? Or does he hear imperfections?",

        "title": "Favorite Films of 2023: Honorable Mentions (alphabetical order)",
        "selftext": "**All Your Faces**: Some movies you just know you're going to love while also being heavy watches and this is definitely the type of lowkey indie drama right up my alley. Based on an actual restorative justice program in France, the film follows convicted felons of non-violent crimes who are about to finish their sentence talking about their crimes and justifications for doing so, with people who've been victims of similar crimes. It's a simple premise that naturally lends itself to tense drama but it also doesn't feel too heavy or melodramatic. All of the actors give naturalistic, human performances that don't make the film heavy handed with its message. Special standouts are Dali Benssalah as one of the convicts trying to explain why well-meaning people are forced to do non-violent crimes, and the always dependable Adèle Exarchopoulos playing a sister scheduled to meet her brother through this program after so many years. It isn't the most groundbreaking from a filmmaking perspective and there aren't any huge twists that you wouldn't expect but the great performances and stripped down writing made this drama stick with me even after so many months.\n\n**Asteroid City**: I think it's far too easy and frankly lazy to simply typecast Wes Anderson as just a quirky director with symmetrical framing, dry humor, and a certain pale color palette. Yes those are present in all of his films but Anderson is a far better writer of not just comedy, but also drama than most dismissive Internet users would have you believe. Now I do also understand why this particular film is a bit divisive even amongst Anderson fans. It's by far his most abstract and loose in narrative structure, with it ultimately not arriving at any big set piece, and even the quirky deadpan comedy is more toned back than his usual films. And yet even amongst the familiar Anderson tropes lies a very touching and thoughtful look at grief and picking up life once what you perceive as your meaning goes away. The characters don't resolve at satisfying resolutions yes, but the film isn't about finding solid life affirming answers but the process of doing so. Having big revelations that solve everything and cause a shift would be against what the film sets out to do and I appreciate that this film took a more mature route in tackling grief. It isn't messy and straightforward but wanting to be on the right path is still a valuable step. It's a good understated film that I gore gets reevaluated as to not be labeled as just another Wes Anderson film. \n\n**The Beasts**: So one of the films I did watch in preparation for this list was R.M.N. which while definitely empathetic to the plight of immigrants in Europe and well acted and written enough to show how Prejudice can breed easily in a small community. Ultimately, I just felt it didn't go hard enough by the end and felt repetitive at times. Now a movie I thought tackled the themes with more heft was The Beasts. And sure on the surface, one is more tension driven while the other focuses on the slow descent of a community so aren’t entirely the same. But I also think there are other aspects to The Beasts as to why I resonated with it more. For one, the ensemble is fantastic - particularly Luis Zahera who really captures a man driven to extremes by economic paranoia. No one feels exaggerated or neatly cookie cutter. Even those who opposed the farmers, aren't evil  per say more so products of the extreme poverty many farmers face. They're desperate and aren't willing to risk anything to their already perilous safety. But second, I think the more independent, less cold perspective is actually able to delve into how bias poisons local communities more. Because it's one thing to see people be misinformed and realize that's where their prejudice comes from. It's another to see it rationalized by people who are barely staying afloat and trying everything to keep them and their loved ones alive, even at the cost of others and even as it drives them to the extreme. It's a rubber band of suspense where every tense interaction and argument makes you wish the strap could be loosened before it's too late and everything snaps back. \n\n**Beyond Utopia**: If you want to talk about depressing documentaries that not only will you want to watch once but you hope will never have to be remade again because of how upsetting they are, this one is an important one to seek out. A film tackling the efforts of an organization to help North Korean citizens evacuate and become refugees, it doesn't shy away from how legitimately tense and scary the whole ordeal is. And they don't shy away from the potential of them failing or people winding up dead, it's a tough process that is an arduous journey from the authoritarian state to a far more safe land. And it also touches on how state propaganda has permanently been ingrained in some refugees that they still can't process how draconian the government is. If I had one nitpick, it's that I think this film could've done away with or even cut out entirely a lot of the talking heads discussing North Korea and background. I think they don't really add much that isn't repeated or hinted at with the actions. But beyond that, it's a film that shows the heroism needed to escape a state so cruel and the depressing reality that this needs to happen in the first place.\n\n**The Eight Mountains**: One of the last films I watch from 2023 and I'm glad I was able to get to this one eventually. A slow meditative meditative introspection about the friends two young men had in their Youth and the impact they'd leave on each other for years afterwards, it's a touching film not just about male friendships but about the small subtle impacts we can have on each other. Even though they rarely reunite or even talk about one another with their loved ones down the line, you can feel the impact of their friendship and how it's not only shaped the men they are today. How they talk with their loved ones now, how they made their own social networks, how both were still soul searching for their purpose years afterwards. And it's just as much about the mountains they climbed literally and figuratively: how many peaks were they satisfied with and how many still could've been traversed. Both of these impacts leave lingering questions inside them. How much of them were they able to discover and how much was left untapped with time unspent? And with absolutely stunning cinematography courtesy of Ruben Impens not just of the breathtaking natural landscapes but also the spaces between, it's a film that left me reflecting on the paths I've traveled and ones I've yet to take. \n\n**Eileen**: Melodrama is often used as a derogatory word but there are times when heightened, over-the-top storytelling can be effective while being aware of the campiness of the scenario. Eileen is just the type of dramatic soap opera story that I could eat up gleefully, one that manages to balance the humor and drama of the story. Anne Hathaway steals the show as the eponymous Eileen. From the first shot, everything from how she's framed to her makeup and costume design against the drab setting, to the discreet expressions from her eyes, there's a magnetism that you immediately feel and understand why MacKenzie Davis would fall for her. Yet there's also a tantalizing mystery around her: who is Eileen? Where was she before she arrived here? How much of her genuinely likes MacKenzie. Rather than answer these questions, the film is about sustaining them throughout the runtime culminating in an ending that's suitably bittersweet and full of pathos. Even if the climax may be a little unsatisfying and the tone overall more dreamlike, I still highly recommend it for the twisted drama and tone. \n\n**Evil Dead Rise**: Sometimes simplicity is all you need to ignore some of the film's flaws. Yes, this isn't as good as Evil Dead 2013 with the gore shockingly feeling tamer and the set-up not fully taking advantage of the high rise setting. But I don't really care because what gore there is, is still wildly creative and fun in a great slapstick way - while I like Fede Alvarez's vision more, I do give credit to Lee Cronin for bringing back some of the humor. But most of all is Alyssa Sutherland's performance: she rips apart the scenery, eats it back up, and spits out in bloody fashion in unironically one of my favorite performances by an actress last year. It's a flawed film to be sure but when you're having this much fun, it's hard to complain too much. \n\n**Four Daughters**: I'm always a bit hesitant towards public art as therapy. Making art can be therapeutic and there's absolutely a nobility in helping people process trauma and grief through art. There is a bit of balancing in also making it not feel exploitative of a person's suffering all in the vague theme of “healing”. But what's good about Four Daughters is that it's more than a family simply retelling their rough upbringing to Iran. We see their reflection and their growth from the reenactments, how much of it is still painful for them to grasp but needed to heal any trauma for the sisters and their fractured family. It's an honest understanding that while it may bring a bit of catharsis to show how unloving their father was to them and to their mother, or how much they finally get to show the mother how her overbearing nature of their mother resulted in the two older sisters ran away, they also know there needs to be a lot more healing done, especially for the daughters some of of now have. There is a sadness in realizing that they're products of their environment, of the abuse and Iran's societal pressures towards women. At the same time, there's strength and power in their determination to stop that cycle of generational pain. Will it actually end here? It's a film that leaves it a bit open ended, especially given the fate of the two older siblings. Healing isn't an easy path but it's better to mend what's left than let toxicity flourish, and for this family, the poison has been recognized and hopefully will be extracted entirely. \n\n**How to Have Sex**: I can't going to speak on behalf of women and how accurate of a portrayal this is of rape at a young age amongst friends. It's not my place to say how accurate this is or how exploitative this could potentially be or how appropriate the tone for a subject this serious should be taken. Although I do know a lot of women have resonated with this story. What I can say is how much this film plays with your expectations. You think from the title and the opening, this will be another light breezy teen movie about a wild weekend trip. I dig the small authentic feel in that it's not some extravagant get away or even a high hotel they're staying at. It's a cheap motel where they spend most of their nights on two balconies with cheap liquor and a few plastic cups, playing music from their own phones and speakers. And dancing in tiny quarters. And then it flips the situation on it's head to show how even in close knit situations amongst friends, girls are still vulnerable to sexual abuse and rape. And while it's not out to make excuses for the men, it also shows that the environment that breeds this sick behavior isn't going to stop even if they did come out and report the crime, it sadly isn't a one time thing…but you sadly already knew that. It's a film that sneaks on you with a heavy gut punch and the director's willingness and uncompromised vision makes it all the more powerful and brave. \n\n**The Iron Claw**: Of all the films I want to love more, this is the one that I'm irritated at myself for doing so. As both a fan of wrestling and a cinephile, this movie should be catnip for me especially as it's an honest portrayal of the golden age of wrestling that works as a celebration and a tragedy without wearing too much into melodramatic tragedy porn that I feel The Wrestler was guilty of at points. And yet...even after all this time, it's a film I think has moments of brilliance but doesn't really come together as a whole. I think the problem was the focus and how much of the story revolves around Kevin. Yes we do get interactions with his brother and their abusive father but most of it is Kevin's slow spiral and realization of the trauma and hurt they've suffered for far too long. And to be clear: it is gripping and Zac Efron unquestionably delivers the best work of his career. Balancing not only the slow confidence to stand up to their father but also trying to work out how to be a proper husband and father himself while having all this trauma. And as I said, it is still a celebration of the Von Erichs and their accomplishments not just as wrestlers but as brothers who stuck with each other. But for me the heavy focus on Kevin also meant that the relationship with his other brothers isn't as developed as it could be. Which is a real shame as both Harris Dickinson and Jeremy Allen White are great as the other Von Erich brothers. I love Dickinson's brooding intensity and Allen White's portraying a post-accident Kerry Von Erich trying to still be the charismatic and athletic athlete that inspired so many in the south. Again, it's a film I do really like…I just wished I loved it and was more consistent overall. \n\n**Kokomo City**: Queer art should have some grit to it, and especially documentaries about queer places and history should feel ragged and rough. There's just something authentic you lose in trying to gussy up underground queer society with a professional look. A lot of documentaries produced by Netflix or Warner Bros. for instance lack this grit and it's why they don't really resonate with me as much even with good intentions. That's just one of the many reasons I loved Kokomo City; its grimy black and white aesthetic and its low rate camera matching the environment and subject matter. But at the same time even with the lo fi aesthetic, there's a lot to enjoy and get sucked into. I love the unfiltered conversations and reflections captured by the pimps and sexworkers: it is not the typical inspiring words of wisdom that most documentaries on the subject would prefer. It's raw and unfiltered, brutally honest and upfront, unafraid of being judged even by other sex workers. Even I'd you disagree, there is something about the confidence and swagger from those in shitty situations not only making the best of it, but still finding ways of self empowerment. It's uplifting in a way that doesn't talk down to queer sex workers and the type most corporations wouldn't touch just because this type of image isn't what they'd like from LGBT people. But it is real and I am saying better we embrace that persona rather than shun them even more than they already have been by society. \n\n**Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One**: Controversial opinion: I didn't really care for Fallout. After both Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, I always felt like Fallout was a regression and simply coasted on some admittedly good stunt work and action scenes, a weak story that lacked tension or suspense, a villain that was laughably ineffective, and just not a lot of growth overall. As such, I was actually hesitant to catch Dead Reckoning as I feared I'd simply grown out of the series. And the first 45 minutes did put me on edge with the slow worldbuilding and I didn't really care for. But quickly, it shifts to high-propulsion with exhilarating action that went unmatched by a lot of other movies. That final train sequence might legitimately be the best set piece of this franchise. And unlike Fallout, you actually do feel the relationships and character between all the people at play, you buy into the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell, and even Pom Klementieff remains a compelling character actor. Yes it is too long and yes the villain is still a rather unengaging one, but this brought me back into why I found the series to be enjoyable in the first place.\n\n**Palm Trees and Power Lines**: It's always a tricky subject trying to navigate a relationship where one is underage, especially in this case where one is explicitly said to be a minor and especially in a story as understated as this. Yet despite the incredibly hard and uncomfortable subject matter of the story and the bleak tone, it was still a movie I couldn't look away from. And a big reason why this film works in the first place is Lily McInerny's performance. You know how doomed of a relationship this is and yet you also perfectly understand why someone her age would fall for the stranger. The older man isn't a rich man where she sees escape or even provides her a lot physically. But the emotional response she gets from her relationship paired with the confused time in her life without proper parental or even guardian guidance, makes you see how easily she'd convince herself of it working. And her being a victim of emotional manipulation makes it all the more heartbreaking when you knew it would've come to this. It isn't an easy film but the blunt realism made it one of the more lingering films from last year. \n\n**Saltburn**: I'll be up front and say I don't know how much of my admiration for this film is ironic or not. Because for people that don't like this film - and I have a friend who hates it - it is a mess both stylistically and thematically. It's up its own ass in how self important and even how weird it is, it doesn't really come together either as social satire or a simple story of obsession of identity, and the tone is a bit all over the place. I think this film kinda exposed Emerald Fennell as being more flash and pizzazz, none of it really complimenting or matching the substance that she wants to imbue in her material. But at the same time, I can't help but be enraptured by the gonzo nature of the film. The acting, whether it be from Barry Keoghan's psychotic behavior to Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant's over-the-top nature, can't help but be entertaining to watch, even if they feel they come from different films. And while I was frequently laughing at the film's absurdity and pretentiousness than with it and I don't really know how much Fennell is aware of her limitations, it's also still a relentless film to watch be it from the bright saturated cinematography, the rapid editing, the curious needledrops, and yes even the bizarre and uneven tone of the film. It's a film where oddly the weaknesses are part of its strengths, and again I don't know how much of the film I actually enjoyed intentionally but it is a film that stuck with me more than a year later and I can't really say that about a lot of films.\n\n**The Taste of Things**: A posted my initial thoughts on this film on Letterboxd awhile back and I was rather mixed on it upon first viewing. And to be clear, I still stand by the fact that this film would have delved deeper in what love communication is like between people - what the responses and reactions our to how we communicate with others is just as important as to how we do so and I think the film lacking that dialogue does blunt some of its impact. It just feels a bit surface level to show their love language through cooking but I never felt a more of a right, long-standing relationship that the film wanted me to feel. But in the end, the foodie in me couldn't help but fall for the gorgeous production design of this film. All the food wasn't pre-made and had to be cooked as they were filming and the crips, warm cinematography from Jonathan Ricquebourg. And while I am still a bit annoyed we only see the surface of the relationship, you do feel the love despite the lack of probing. That you see the care and love put into the cuisine in both how it looks and likely tastes does capture how much it took to hone the craft of cooking and of love. Even if it's ultimately more enriching to look at and think about that watch as a whole, it was a meal I was left satisfied\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8zyvaa4322e1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6a30ad7fb12f2bfe7694a491451ab5fa5d0845\n\n",

I've been musing on a few already and I was interested if anyone had any more to offer:\n\n**The Greatest Showman**: A movie about a huckster showman who believed it was ok to lie to your audience as long as they enjoyed themselves. Fittingly, the movie is incredibly inaccurate, geared instead towards people's enjoyment of an entertaining lie.\n\n**Jurassic World:** A franchise revival of an old property filled with product placement and shock value, where the park, Jurassic World, is built on reviving the past (both Hammond's park and dinosaurs themselves), it's filled with product placement and dinosaurs have been genetically engineered for shock value (to be honest it might've been interesting if they'd embraced this metaphor more in the film!)\n\n**Catch Me If You Can:** A movie about a conman forging his professions, which has turned out to be largely fictional forgery by that same conman.\n\nAny others?",

She did seem a bit upset and irritated by his presence when he returned to see her after he stormed off when she had caught him peeking at her. So perhaps she took advantage of the situation to give him a taste of his own medicine. Or was there another reason as to why she peeked on him, especially because she promised she wouldn’t look while he got undressed for his shower. \n\nAlso, for those of you that have read the book, does this scenario also happened in the book?

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nsince (not only) a few days I'm asking you for your favorite movie set in a given european country. I really enjoy it, but sometimes it also involves a bit of what I would like to call “administrative work”. For example, the wording of the question sometimes leads to confusion: films from a certain country are mentioned from time to time, although it is not at all clear whether the film is actually *set* in that country. Unfortunately, I've seen very few of the movies on the list so far (which is one of the reasons why I'm doing this) - so I often have to rely on *you*.\n\nThis is particularly important for films that have actually won for “their” country - and in fact it was recently questioned whether *Straume* (engl.: *Flow*), the winner for Latvia, actually takes place in Latvia plot-wise or not. (For those who want to follow or even join the discussion: Here is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/BalticStates/comments/1gvlysh/favorite_movie_by_european_country_latvia_which/).) At the same time, there's another hurdle with this project that you can't help me with very much: the schedulin : I like it a lot to announce yesterday's winner with the next post. However, the round for Lithuania is not quite over yet (even if a trend is already emerging), while I will be gone later. So here's the next country prematurely: We're looking for movies set in **Luxemburg**... and these are the rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: Since the competition for Lithuania is still running, I will refrain from updating the list here, which otherwise still follows, and instead I would like to draw your attention once again to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).",

Then when it got to the whole toxins thing and being expelled from the cult it made me reconsider that the husband was aware that this would happen and that is why he committed the act. She would never have consented to sex so he made it happen the only way he could.\n\nWe don't know a lot about the cult but cults generally aren't a good thing, they certainly don't look good to most people outside of them. The husband lost his wife and mother of his child to a cult and he was willing to do whatever it took to try and get her out of it. \n\nThere's certainly an argument that the ends don't justify the means but I didn't think that it was as black and white as the husband just being evil. \n\nI'm curious to hear anyone's thoughts.",

The Mandoloreon tho does do a little better when he gets his beskar armor, he takes less cover and exposes himself to enemy fire a lot more after he gets it\n\n The MCU does a little better at times, iron man starts with limitations, and does take damage, but they also apply it in ridiculous ways too, protection against things like free falling without a parachute or getting crushed by a meteor the size of a movie theater. In the final battle Thanos does perform much better wearing his armor so there's another good example \n\nToo often melee weapons just punch through armor like it was never there at all, ironically 300 does a decent job with the little they're carrying, even if it is just helmets and shields \n\nI know it would make fight scenes a lot longer to resolve but I still want to see more people withstand more damage when they're wearing armor, in general ",

Years later I was excited to see Criterion Channel had put it on and I rewatched it. I was little confused when I got to the ending as there is almost an hour added to the film and I felt as though the added subplot to the ending of the film dragged on a bit as it is very dialogue heavy.\n\nRecently, I purchased Arrow’s Blu-Ray release of the film that includes both cuts of the movie and, for sake of time, rewatched the theatrical cut. However, this time I felt as though the ending happened too fast and we lose a lot of time and story with older Toto.\n\nThat being said, I love Tornatore’s films and I think both cuts ultimately are absolutely amazing films. The main meat of the film with young Toto is mainly unchanged between either version and is still the biggest draw for the film.\n\nJust was wondering what everyone else thinks. Which one do you prefer? If I had to say, I would lean more towards the theatrical honestly.",

To see their reactions, because it's funny, makes me feel weird and interesting.\n\nBut I'm still trying to figure out what would be the best movie for this situation.\n\nA couple of ground rules:\n\n1. It can't be a great movie, it needs to be either mid or terrible. Because I think the bit works better if it's not some cinematic masterpiece.\n\n2. It can't be something that might make paint me in a negative light. Nothing that will make someone worry about me or think I'm a weird creep. So nothing like Saw, Human Centipede, Starship Troopers etc...\n\n3. It has to be a movie that people are generally aware of. The bit doesn't work if they don't know what the movie is.\n\n4. Ideally, a shorter movie so It's less of a chore to watch. So 90 minutes-ish.\n\nSo far, the best candidates me and my friends have come up with is the 2009 Astroboy Movie, one of the Ice Age movies, one of the Fast and Furious movies, Jurassic Park 2 or 3, high school musical 2 or 3, Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, and Suicide Squad.\n\nAny suggestions for my bizarre little conundrum?",

        "title": "Who Am I (2014) - A german hacker movie - Ending is not what you think it is.",
        "selftext": "I saw this movie only recently and watched it multiple times since then. The ending shows us that Benjamin staged his multiple personality disorder in order to fool the Europol agent, so he could protect his Clay crew - Max, Stefan and Paul - and erase his identity. However, there are hints throughout the movie indicating that there is one additional layer to the story.\n\nIn my opinion Benjamin suffers from multiple personality disorder (perhaps inherently, or from taking too much Ritalin, or both) and imagines other CLAY members (not Marie, though). All 4 members are facets of his personality (just like in case of his mom), helping him to deal with reality. Here are my observations supporting this:\n\n\\* His other personalities started manifesting when a) he starts using Ritalin, and b) he faces a difficult time in his life (being caught hacking the university, thus not giving Marie the exam answers, thus his plans for the bright future with her as he imagined it are foiled, plus, as he stated, he had to clean the city that gives no damn about him). Shortly after he started doing his community service (and taking a Ritalin pill) his first additional personality - Max - manifests.\n\n\\* Later he manifests Stefan and Paul at the party. Benjamin is the one throwing the golden statue and breaking the window and he is the one taking Marie with him. You can tell by Marie being instantly focused on him after the window is broken (not on Stefan).\n\n\\* Later in the supermarket it is also Benjamin (''saved'' by Max) flirting with Marie and the other girl after unsuccessful flirting with her while being just himself. That's why Marie is already attracted to him when they meet at the rave party in the club after the BND hack.\n\n\\* As his cooperation with other CLAY memebers intesifies, so does their (or rather his) consumption of Ritalin. Conincidence?\n\n\\* During the party after the BND hack Benjamin is seen taking a Ritalin pill in the bathroom (followed by a Fight-Club-esque synapses vizualization) and shortly after that he sees Max kissing Marie. However, for a brief moment there is a (another Fight-Club-esque) flash showing the truth - that it was in fact Benjamin who was kissing Marie. What happened was that Benjamin's 'Max personality' took over, because Benjamin wasn't brave enough to make such move by himself, so he was simply left out to to be a spectator in that moment.\n\n\\* This is further supported by the fact that when Marie comes to visit Benjamin in his house the next day, Benjamin asks her if she came to see Max, to which she replied ''Max? No.'' in a confused manner, apparently not knowing what Benjamin is talking about, because there was no Max at the party with her, only Benjamin.\n\n\\* His rant about him being whoever he wants to be and being ''bunt'' (colorful) also indicates that he has a split personality. Marie playfully said that he is weird - also a hint that his behaviour is wildly inconsistent (from being a window-breaking Stefan, through being a charistmatic and funny Max, to being an awkward Benjamin).\n\n\\* There is a scene at the end of the movie where a figure wearing a clown mask appears, however, the Europol agent doesn't spot it, even though she is facing the figure's direction. Benjamin, however, was nervously looking at it when he was about to leave the car the first time, just before the Europol agent stopped him and asked him how the trick works.\n\n\\* Marie never interacts with more than one CLAY member at the same time. Nor does anyone else. Even in the very last scene when they all meet on the ferry, her and Benjamin's conversation perfectly holds without the Benjamin's interaction with other 3 CLAY members.\n\nSUMMARY: Benjamin suffers from multiple personalities disorder and he conjures 3 pals up in order to help him handle life better and to get the girl of his dreams. As in cases of Fight Club or Mr. Robot, Benjamin focuses his frustrations of being nobody, lonely and ignored on society, hacking everyone and everything he can, proving he is worthy and trying to impress his idol MRX.\n\nHe gets the girl, but also gets mixed up with cybermafia, so with Marie's help (who also agrees to run away with him) and with help of his 3 imaginary buddies he conjures up a plan faking an illness he already has. He succeeded and meets Marie on a ferry to Coppenhagen. The only debatable thing is whether Benjamin is aware of his condition or not. If not, then he genuinly believed he was making the disorder up in order to fool the Europol agent and become invisible again, making it a triple-twist ending, which is not bad at all.",

His storytelling often operates on the edge of surrealism but is always deeply rooted in psychological realism, to the point where almost everything feels intimate and grounded.\n\nPerfect Blue for me is a movie where all of this is in full swing, and I was wondering if there are other animated movies that at least do a good job at portraying similar human internal conflicts.\n\nExtra points if it’s atmospheric, a crime based/police thriller, or delves into some horror elements as well.\n\nThere are other movies I have seen that I would offer as a reference and also recommend, to set the tone :\n\n●Pet Shop of Horrors\n\n●Belladona of Sadness\n\n●Metropolis\n\n●Kite\n\n●Paprika & Millenium Actress (Of course)\n\n●The sky crawlers\n\n●Wicked City",

I remember really enjoying it around the time it came out, and while it isn't perfect/the best action movie from the 90's I think there's plenty to enjoy here.\n\nTravolta is chewing the scenery as the villain and doing a great job in my opinion. Lots of quotables and just a good screen presence. The plot is interesting with some memorable action scenes and deaths and upon rewatching I was pleasantly surprised by the lead actress role. She isn't a damsel in distress but heroic and capable from the start and throughout the movie. She is on par with the protagonist almost which is a nice deviation from the norm at the time.\n\nAll in all for the type of movie that it is I'd give it a 8-.\n\nSo, is there any love for this movie here or am I alone in this one?\n\nedit: For people unfamiliar with the movie, I'd compare it to something like Under Siege.

How did he go from making movies like this and The Crow to CGI-laden nonsense like Gods of Egypt? No offense if you like that movie, but it doesn't feel like the same filmmaker. He was a master of gothic-influenced genre movies for a while.\n\nThe visual effects and production design are really impressionistic and awesome. You really get the impression that every piece of architecture in this world is steeped in history, even though it's all just an illusion at the end of the day. Speaking of illusions, I also love the idea of aliens that can alter reality. The Strangers are great villains - terrifying, actually. The kid is especially eerie.\n\nI also love the film's nods to Last Thursdayism, a theory that the universe might have been created very recently (last Thursday, for instance), but with the appearance of being much older. I think that's quite a cool idea, and the movie incorporates it into the narrative in a very interesting way. I've also read that it's supposed to represent Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" idea, which is also fascinating. The philosophical elements don't come across as pretentious, though - it's very accessible.\n\nThis is as good as cinema gets for me. How do you guys feel about it?",

Unlike several recent tuners, which tried to hide their musical dimension from audiences, “Wicked” embraces its identity the way Elphaba does her emerald skin. Turns out such confidence makes all the difference in how they’re perceived.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (90)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-1236062372/)\n\n>Grande and Erivo give Stephen Schwartz’s songs — comedy numbers, introspective ballads, power anthems — effortless spontaneity. They help us buy into the intrinsic musical conceit that these characters are bursting into song to express feelings too large for spoken words, not just mouthing lyrics and trilling melodies that someone spent weeks cleaning up in a studio.\n\n[Deadline:](https://deadline.com/2024/11/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-movie-musical-adaptation-1236181476/)\n\n>Chu has made a movie musical (the best since *Chicago)*, even if it ends with its own “intermission” , that manages to stand on its own as a fully satisfying screen entertainment, and also serves as a delicious invitation to an upcoming second half I quite frankly can’t wait to see.\n\n[IndieWire (67)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wicked-review-jon-m-chu-adaptation-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-1235065351/)\n\n>Jon M. Chu’s Massive Musical Adaptation Defies Gravity (and Logic) to Spin a Tale Mostly for Established Fans. Ariana Grande is an absolute scream and Cynthia Erivo's voice is unparalleled, but expanding out the Broadway musical into two (very long) parts doesn't offer the opportunity for depth we were promised.\n\n[TheWrap (80)](https://www.thewrap.com/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-universal/)\n\n>The story’s playful, subversive reinterpretation of 'The Wizard of Oz' as a work of propaganda, designed to obfuscate the true story of how political dissidents and minority groups are demonized by fascist con artists who trade in theatricality instead of competence, is fully developed and still (to our collective dismay) incredibly salient.\n\n[IGN (90)](https://www.ign.com/articles/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-jon-m-chu)\n\n>Wicked is a well-oiled machine in the hands of Jon M. Chu. This film adaptation epitomizes what modern movie musicals can and should be, embracing its source material while cleverly translating it to screen. Tear-jerking performances by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo make the movie, playing to their individual strengths to bring to life the rapport between Glinda and Elphaba, who’ll go on to become the good and wicked witches of Wizard of Oz fame. If as many people love this film as much as I did, Wicked will undoubtedly immortalize the Grande and Erivo in movie musical history.\n\n[The Guardian (80)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/19/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-wizard-of-oz-stephen-schwartz)\n\n>It’s arguable if Wicked could ever be a meaningfully persuasive prequel for the characters in The Wizard of Oz as we actually see them in the 1939 film, as this would involve cancelling their powerfully timeless, mythological aura, and instead substituting the more banal idea of human development. But this is the joke, and this is the story, and what an enjoyable spectacle it is.\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241119-wicked-review)\n\n>It might have been lighter on its feet if the editors had cut a subplot about magical talking animals, which doesn't add anything except several minutes of running time. And they could have cut Elphaba's sister, who is given perplexingly little to do. That way, the film could have been packed the whole musical into one fast-moving, satisfying entertainment. As it is, I have a strong suspicion that Wicked will work much better as the first part of a double bill, with Wicked Part 2 being shown after an interval. But we'll have to wait another year to know for sure.\n\n[Independent - UK (3/5)](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/wicked-movie-review-ariana-grande-b2649890.html)\n\n>Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande showcase phenomenal vocal ability in this adaptation of the blockbuster musical, but they’re let down by a film that is aggressively overlit and shot like a TV advert.\n\n[Telegraph - UK (2/5)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo/)\n\n>Utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo don’t come close to defying gravity in this bloated, beige screen adaptation of the Wizard of Oz prequel.\n\n[Total Film (100)](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/musicals/wicked-part-one-review/)\n\n>A great deal of expectation and pressure had been placed on Wicked, with fans waiting decades for it to reach the screen. This makes what Chu has achieved an even greater feat, turning one of the world's most popular musicals into a cinematic phenomenon. And while Wicked is only one half of this story, it never feels incomplete. As part two will take this story to some weird, wonderful, and heartbreaking places, I cannot wait to see what he and his team accomplish. But at this rate? I don't think anything can bring them down.\n\n[Empire Magazine (80):](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wicked/)\n\n>Chu amps up the colour and spectacle to extraordinary, almost overwhelming heights, but the real magic comes from Erivo and Grande as the frenemies at the story’s heart. \n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2024/11/wicked-part-1-review-cynthia-erivo/)\n\n>The film is effective at capturing what made the original musical so beloved, and in turn, will belong to a new generation of kids — those kids who might then envision themselves cathartically singing “Popular” or “Defying Gravity” on stage, just as Ariana Grande had as a child.\n\n[Collider (90)](https://collider.com/wicked-movie-review/)\n\n>The film works on an emotional level, and yet there are also well-delivered lessons about growing fascism that are tragically poignant in our American era. The set pieces are big and bold, and the dance numbers are creative and colorful. Grande is continually hilarious as the charmingly vapid Galinda, while Erivo is breathtakingly powerful as the so-called Wicked Witch. **Both Grande and Erivo sound glorious** through beautiful interpretations of modern musical classics like \"Defying Gravity.\" It all coheres into **one of the best silver screen adaptations of a musical in ages**, and easily one of the year's best pictures.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (75)](https://ew.com/wicked-review-musical-adaptation-hits-right-notes-lacks-visual-variety-8747457)\n\n>For now, like Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune, this Wicked manages to end on a note of “to be continued” while still feeling like a complete story. If only its imagery had a little more magic!\n\n[Screenrant (90)](https://screenrant.com/wicked-movie-review/)\n\n>Save for the tiniest of things, Wicked is a worthy screen adaptation of the musical, guaranteed to make viewers feel like they could defy gravity too.\n\n[The Times - UK (80)](https://www.thetimes.com/article/d6c0c3b5-efcc-4d7e-bca6-6c98ec4e997b)\n\n>Hollywood finally delivers a worthy successor to The Wizard of Oz with this musical adaptation, starring the superb Erivo as Elphaba and a startlingly good Ariana Grande as Glinda.\n\n[Vanity Fair (80)](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-movie-review)\n\n>Wicked succeeds because of some unreproducible, lightning in a bottle convergences—of director, stars, craftspeople, and high-status material. But Wicked also makes a broader case for patience and careful thought, for grand ambition honed over the course of many years. In order to defy gravity, gravity must first be understood.\n\n[iNews - UK (100)](https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/ariana-grande-wicked-review-3388833)\n\n>It joyfully expands on the source material with extended musical numbers and astute childhood flashbacks in a combination that will delight committed Ozians and newcomers alike.\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle (100)](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/wicked-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-19901874)\n\n>Fueled by exquisite performances from Tony winner Erivo (“The Color Purple”), as Elphaba, or the Wicked Witch of the West, and Grammy winner Grande as Glinda the Good Witch, “Wicked” is the best movie musical in years, representing a rare instance when performances, visuals and songs are of equally high quality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n>Elphaba, a misunderstood young woman because of her green skin, and Glinda, a popular girl, become friends at Shiz University in the Land of Oz.

Like we don't have to spend brain power on that, AI will just do it.

        "title": "The Three Minute TRAP Test (sorry, another TRAP post)",
        "selftext": "Mucho Spoilers ahead.\n\nI know, I know – another TRAP thread… sorry.  I made a comment in a previous thread stating when I watched it I couldn’t go 3 minutes without saying “Come on!”  At the time it was a hyperbolic statement, but it got me to thinking and I began to seriously wonder if that was the case.  Could three minutes go by without something stupid happening that brought me out of the emersion of the movie?  I understand one has to suspend some level of belief for just about any movie, but could TRAP make it three minutes without crashing? \n\nWhat I found, if you take out the initial car ride with Cooper and Riley and all the long Lady Raven concert sequences… well, I’ll let you judge.  Sorry, this is super super long, but by the very nature of the post, it had to be.  If you don’t like long posts, better bail now (if you haven’t already).\n\nWay TLDR; TRAP stupidity flies by at an incredible pace.\n\nThe timestamps are more for time between events and may not be exact depending on your streaming platform.  (MAX had a commercial at the start which may vary in length)\n\n4:45 – At the line to enter the venue, sooo many paper tickets being held, even in the mobile only access line which they make a point to show.  What is this, 1998?  Paper concert tickets even a thing anymore?  Awkward exposition about Riley’s friend issues.  As a dad, this is a bad place to discuss, but not a terrible movie sin.  Not like we’re gonna see very soon.\n\n5:10 – Cooper notices heightened security (SWAT).  If you’re setting a trap, why make security look excessive on the way in?  It’s a long concert, show up in force later so as not to tip your hand too soon.  A few moments later you see uniformed police literally elbow to elbow, all the way across the exit doors.  If I was a non-serial killer parent I’d be concerned at this point thinking there was some sort of terrorist plot against the event that had been found out.  I’d be asking questions.\n\n6:15 – Cooper and Riley find the only available table in the entire arena ever shown in the movie to sit and eat.  Very lucky.\n\n6:50 – Again, we see 8 uniformed police officers standing elbow to elbow blocking an exit section of doors.  Do they need 8 officers at each exit?? What is their purpose at this point?  Nobody’s trying to leave, can’t 1 or 2 suffice?  More red flags to Cooper.\n\n6:55 – What is this officer doing, adding extra cameras to the venue? You mean they don’t already have cameras covering every inch of that venue that they need more and let’s send a uniformed officer to add it directly above a SWAT member holding an AR type weapon?? Nothing to see here.\n\n7:33 – Here we see 6 uniformed officers at two different section exits inside the auditorium just standing there, which makes the implication they’re that many at ALL the internal auditorium exits.  Why?  What’s the purpose?  We can see Cooper later in the movie moving freely between the auditorium and venue concourses, what are they doing other than making him nervous and want to figure out what’s going on?  Again, as a normal parent I might be wanting to get out of there myself.  I did the math, there are 48 total sections at the FirstOntario Centre (filming venue) used during concerts NOT including floor exits.  That would be almost 300 officers just on exits in view of everyone inside.  Nobody seems to care.\n\nWe also see our first suspect being escorted out for questioning.  How did they pick this guy?  They just going to question every dad there with a kid (oh yeh, we find out later that’s the plan)?  What will questioning hope to resolve anyway?  They hope The Butcher will fold and confess? I guess maybe just to get info to track later, but if it was me, I’d be like, ‘hell no you can’t have my ID, what crime do you have a reasonable, articulable suspicion to think I’ve committed and, other than being at this concert what is your probable cause?’\n\n11:08 – Cooper views his captor in a crowded restroom with the volume up.  Seems kinda stupid on his part, but not incredibly bad.  Good thing captive didn’t scream out ‘help me!’ or anything, because it might have been awkward on his leaving the stall.  One note, I’ve seen much scarier murder/captive rooms in movies before – the washer/dryer combo in the back doesn’t really instill much fear for the viewer.\n\n12:32 – Cooper just happens to run into the mother of one of Riley’s friends she’s having issues with.  FirstOntario Centre looks to have about 90,000 square feet, so pretty amazing coincidence.  Man, she seems over the top excited to see him and to want to talk about the issues the daughters are having in the middle of a concert where most people are trying to hurry back to their seat and not miss much of the performance (which NOBODY in the background is trying to do).  Also, we’re back in front of the Shake Shack.  It seems a lot of stuff in this movie occurs in the same places – very noticeable.  I’m sure that happens a lot in movies, but here they don’t seem to try and hide it.\n\n13:05 – Even MORE SWAT shows up.  I’m beginning to think the entire Philadelphia PD is on-site at this point.  It looks like they’re surrounding the entire building, shoulder to shoulder like Hands Across America.\n\n15:31 – More constitutional rights are being violated as another father is shown being illegally detained for questioning.  Illegal profiling at its best – ‘White male over 30?  Come with me!’   This guy has a jacket similar to Cooper, so maybe they’ve profiled what he’s wearing?? IDK.\n\n16:02 – Another row of uniformed officers just standing behind Cooper, again shoulder to shoulder like they expect the suspect to make a dash through the line like a game of Red Rover, Red Rover.\n\n16:40 – Ok, here we are with the 1^(st) interaction with the t-shirt concessionaire, Jaime. So, Cooper lets the other girl take the last shirt so now Jaime feels it’s ok to tell this guy the entire plan about the concert being a trap for The Butcher?!?  Seriously?  Also, why would they even tell all the concession workers what was going on in the first place?? That shit would be all over social media 30 seconds after they did.  Tells Cooper the only way out is backstage??? Come on.  All Cooper really needs to do is keep pretending and walk out at the end of the concert with everybody else.  What do they have on him that points to him being The Butcher??  If they knew anything about him, it might possibly be where he’s sitting and since they haven’t dragged him out, they obviously don’t know that.\n\n18:55 – Scene with the drunk lady at the steps.  Her friend is holding her so she won’t fall, literally 1 foot from a flight of stairs, then for no reason leaves her there swaying??? Great friend! Cooper knocks her down the stairs with like 6-8 people looking right at him and NOBODY notices?!?! Unreal.  Also, what was his plan here?  Grab Riley and make a dash for the door the police left (only 2 this time, where’s the rest of the convoy?).  Riley would’ve made a HUGE scene, “Dad, where are we going?!?! I don’t want to leave yet?!?! What’s wrong, why are you doing this?!?!”  Anybody that ever had a teenage daughter would know this… I’m looking at you M. Night…\n\n22:16 – Cooper suggests to Riley they climb down the trap door to see what’s down there.  Even a teenage girl knows how stupid that is and tells him so.  Again, all he needs to do is play it cool and walk out at the end of the concert.  Oh, and that trap door after closing looks like a hella tripping hazard and a huge lawsuit waiting to happen, not to mention how it was just opened like that, and anyone could fall into it during a dark event like a concert.\n\n23:35 – Cooper goes back to the concession stand to get the t-shirt.  Jaime, KNOWING THE BUTCHER IS IN THE BUILDING, lets this random guy he just met go with him to the back to get the shirt.  Jaime has had his badge on his collar all night, but now decides to put it in his back pocket so Cooper can easily take it.  We learn Jaime just happens to have been following The Butcher closely.  We find out they had a training thing obviously before the event where they gave all the workers a super secret password.  Again, 30 seconds after that training event, social media would be flooded with the news so it would have been out before the concert.  Of course, Jaime gives random guy he just met the password because he told him he is a fireman?  Good Lord.  Oh, and Jaime only takes like 3 of the shirts they’re out of back to the stand, leaving the full box on that table – terrible employee.\n\n26:25 – Cooper uses stolen access card to gain entry to where about 30 more (good god) SWAT officers just HAPPEN to be giving a briefing update on the status of the hunt… what are the odds?!?  Oh wait, it’s not a status update, it’s more exposition on one of The Butcher’s previous victims.  Why this here and now, don’t these guys have someplace they need to be lording over?\n\n27:12 – Cooper puts the magic assess badge on his jacket, which makes him magically invisible so he can walk through all those SWAT guys.  So, up to this point every vendor or worker has been wearing some type of uniform or shirt.  This guy that completely matches the profile of all the guys you’ve been unconstitutionally escorting out of the arena, wearing street clothes, can just walk through ALL of them.  Not ONE officer even gives him a second look because of that magic badge??? One even asks him for sugar??  Come on…  Sorry, have to point this out, when the SWAT guy stirs his coffee, the cup is obviously empty.  Oh, and Cooper steals a police walkie-talkie that just happens to be lying around. \n\n28:12 – Cooper just happens to AGAIN run into that overbearing mom.  Dang, I think she’s stalking him or something.  Why is she so adamant about clearing up the girl’s issues??  She actually aggressively assaults him when he tries to walk away by grabbing his arm, then threatens him.  Why is this going on?  Maybe to get the attention of the police and build suspense?  The scene ends with someone being thrown to the ground and cuffed, probably for standing up for his constitutional rights and failing to ID.\n\n31:15 – Cooper listens to the walkie-talkie and discovers that the possible suspect just MIGHT have a tattoo on his right arm of rabbit or animal.  We see the tattoo on the inside wrist of Cooper.  It’s so small and light and in such an area one has to wonder how this was seen well enough to tell it was an animal at all, but you couldn’t get ANY other details concerning him physically other than being a white male in his 30’s?  Seriously?  The other profiles they’re looking for, African American men of above average height, a red-headed male, and a white-haired man in his 60’s…. so literally any man.  You can’t make this shit up, well I guess you can, but…\n\n32:45 – Dr. Grant (retirement age profiler) just HAPPENS to remind everyone of the alarm contingency at the EXACT moment Cooper is considering it.  Wow, good timing…. or bad, depends on how you look at it.\n\n33:46 – Cooper devises a plan to get to the roof (why?) by blowing up the fryer in the concession stand.  The jars of oil are clearly shown in the middle of the concession area, right where so many employees walk by constantly, the fryers are even further back kitchen area.  It’s implied he gains access via the employees only door so I guess, in street clothes, he walks by every worker back there, turns up the fryer (why?), lifts a couple of those massive oil jars and eases them into the already full fryer without a single soul noticing???? Come on!  So stupid.  Cooper then steals conveniently placed, stealth-powered cooking apron and opens unlocked, and now unguarded, roof access door.\n\n35:13 – Cooper is now on the roof and is met by two members of the SWAT team.  Again as I mentioned earlier, all vendors and workers to date have been wearing some kind of shirt or uniform.  However, here Cooper is matching the profile of the killer, wearing STREET clothes except for this magic apron and it’s all good because he knows the super-secret password that couldn’t have possibly been given out to anyone that shouldn’t have it.  What was his plan anyway, to jump from the roof and leave his daughter to be looking for him?  Riley would go to the first available officer, probably sitting in her lap, and tell them my daddy is missing.  Hmmm… maybe THAT’s our guy?\n\nOh, and as luck (again) would have it, the magic stealth apron Cooper took has a wallet with the card handed out at the vendor security presentation earlier.  Man, Cooper should really go to Vegas right now.\n\n36:31 – We’re shown 2 EMTs taking the blood pressure of the burn victim.  Man, these guys show no urgency whatsoever.  They’re just chillin, taking their time while she moans, shakes and cries in severe pain.  No treatment for the wounds, no rushing her out of the building.  Nope, getting that vital BP.  Damn, get moving assholes!!\n\n38:50 – Cooper again draws a royal flush and happens to find Lady Raven’s uncle to give him the sad cancer story to get backstage.  Lucky to find the uncle, and also lucky he’s still gullible enough to believe that sad sack story.  Not like anyone else ever tried to get backstage by lying about something like that.  Oh, and it just happens to be a dude that fits the profile (you know, having a penis) that they’ve all been warned might try and get out of the building anyway possible. \n\n40:12 – Another unconstitutional detainment.  This time the suspect looks like a man of color, so most definitely profiling… standing while black.\n\n41:30 – Backstage. SWAT guy wants to talk with Cooper, but nah… Uncle Gullible has already vetted him and he’s all good.  Whispers to SWAT guy the lame cancer story and that makes everything ok.  Cooper even gets an ‘all good’ and bro head nod from the officer.  Cooper proceeds to walk past about 20 of Philly’s finest that are for some reason all bunched up backstage?  I don’t know.\n\n44.17 – Wow, that was the longest gap in stupidity excluding the concert viewings, but we DID get detailed instructions of how Riley is to handle the dreamer girl thing.  We also got closeups of Cooper and Dr. Grant like they were in some kind of battle of intellect or something… matching superior intellects to see who would win this thing.  Anyway, we see Riley’s friends eat shit as they see her be the dreamer girl.  I’m not sure what Riley did to piss them all off so bad, but she makes quite the scene.  At this point, I’m more interested in this backstory, maybe a prequel?\n\n46:10 – Dr. Grant literally says, ‘If anyone tries to get backstage, let me know.”  <facepalm>\n\n46:35 – Cooper, again in right place at right time, catches fainting girl and uses her as a human shield to get further backstage.  They let Cooper just get in this girl’s face and treat her, rummage through medical supplies, etc.  Even call him a “Gem”.  Worst. Security. Ever. \n\n48:00 – Manager lets Cooper stand backstage for the remainder of the show so he can see more very convenient things like, Lady Raven using an inhaler… which I don’t recall ever being exploited unless it has to do with sympathy for the captive and the threat of carbon monoxide use? Who knows.\n\n49:40 – Cooper asks manager if they could exit backstage after the concert to get to their car… “Sure.. no worries..”  Um… aren’t they supposed to watch out for people trying to exit from the backstage area?  At this point I guess you could make the assumption that NOBODY in the Lady Raven camp was warned about the trap; however, we find out later this wasn’t the case.\n\n52:06 – Manager nicely informs Cooper that only Lady Raven and her closely guarded group are excluded from questioning.  Why?  Why wouldn’t some late addition, unknown male in his 30’s be questioned even if he was with Lady Raven?? He might be the GD Butcher!\n\n52:50 – Exposition from Dr. Grant informs us there will be 3,000 illegal detainments of men on the way out of the venue.  A Saul Goodman class-action wet dream.\n\n53:35 – Creepy old Cooper asks Lady Raven to speak with her completely alone.  On an average day without a serial killer in the building, this would be a hard pass.  Today… “Of course!”  Cooper starts talking about carbon monoxide and dying and Lady Raven just stands there and listens.  I mean, she listens to crazy talk for a good 30 seconds before she even learns someone might die at Cooper’s command.  So… why the hell doesn’t she run out of the room screaming bloody murder?  She’s world famous, she has to have seen crazy before and know what crazy looks like.  RUN!!\n\n56:10 – We get a view of SWAT guys escorting all the men leaving the venue at gunpoint to covered tents for illegal interrogations.  Probably much like it looked in Berlin circa 1943.\n\n56:19 – We see Lady Raven, Cooper and Riley being escorted down a backstage corridor with no less than 20 SWAT officers holding AR’s lining the wall.  Why? What an incredible waste of resources.  Crime spiked in Philly as there were exactly NO officers on the beat that day.   Where’s her entourage? Her manager? Anyone?  So, if it wasn’t for Cooper and Riley she’d be completely alone walking to her limo after the concert?  Nah.  All the way to the limo NOBODY questions the new guy that perfectly fits the profile of the 30ish white male?\n\n57:10 – Image of Dr. Grant being absolutely no help staring directly into a glass door as people exit to either side of her. Oh, and it’s still perfectly sunny outside.  This was an “afternoon” concert and obviously winter so the days are shorter.  There were warmup bands and all… why is it still light out?  Cooper mentioned that it was the earliest he could get off work and they were later than Riley wanted to be, so he obviously went to work that morning at the fire department.\n\n57:15 – We see the limo driving up the parking garage ramp which is… get this… lined by 7 more SWAT officers!! What the hell were they guarding here?!?!  Oh wait.. there are 5 more at the garage exit that move the barriers for the limo.  THEN OMG, THERE IS ANOTHER SET OF BARRIERS ONE CAR LENGTH LATER THAT NEED MOVING, which the next set of 6 SWAT officers move.  None think to stop the limo to check the occupants or anything, they just wave them out.  The limo passes even more SWAT lined up on the street, shoulder to shoulder, guarding the curb.  Unreal.\n\n \n\nOK, so Cooper is officially out of the building.  This is where I hear a lot of folks say this movie went off the rails.  I’ve even heard the above called a “tight” and a “suspenseful thriller”.   I’m sorry, how can tension build if every three minutes something happens to pull you out of the moment?  Anyway, back to the breakdown.\n\n \n\n57:45 – Cooper asks Lady Raven to be dropped off at the corner.  What is his plan at this point, go home like nothing happened?  They have a video of his daughter on stage, they’ll know who he is and from there it’s just a matter of time.  But no, now Lady Raven wants to go to their house?? Why?  She should just let them out and immediately call the police.  She’d be safe, there’d be a better chance to help the guy being held captive… but no.  She somehow now wants to be the protagonist of the movie and somehow save the day? I guess Lady Raven knows she’s M. Night’s daughter and this is her movie now.\n\n1:02:40 – We find out Lady Raven DID know the entire time about The Butcher being at the concert.  So, no excuses for any of the staff’s previous stupidity.  Also, what legal team would allow this to go on??  Can you imagine the possible litigation of knowingly allowing a concert to go on with all those kids and guns under the same roof, not to mention a serial killer they know zero about.  They found a “receipt for the ticket purchase” at one of his safe houses.  Who keeps a paper receipt to anything these days, much less a concert???  It’s all on mobile devices.  We’ve already seen Cooper’s pretty handy with cameras and mobile devices, but he keeps a paper receipt? \n\n1:03:30 – At Coop’s house with the fam, Lady Raven goes on and on about all the FBI “knows” about the killer, yet she didn’t think to question anyone about the guy backstage that fits the bill?  Oh, and now he’s just a 30ish white male, forget all those other combos.  They even know he has a black car because he’s OCD and it shows less dirt… crazy how smart they are.  It’s been my experience that black shows more smudges and fingerprints, so I don’t know about that.  Still, no clue what Lady Raven’s end-game is here.  What the hell is she planning to do that she couldn’t do better by leaving now and calling someone???\n\n1:06:30 – Lady Raven grabs Cooper’s phone and runs to the bathroom where she just HOPES I guess it isn’t locked and she can access the app to talk to the captive in HOPES he can help locate his position by remembering something he saw or can see now? I don’t know… Spencer (the captive) happens to have been conscious after the obduction and could see a broken lion statue and blue door.  Cooper’s luck has turned for a moment.\n\n1:08:10 – Instead of immediately calling 911, Lady Raven decides to livestream to help find Spencer based on the info he provided.  In retrospect, if she’d been aware of how completely inept the police/FBI had been to that point, this was a really good idea.  However, she doesn’t so it’s pretty stupid on her part.\n\n1:09:19 – Lady Raven texts her driver to call the police.  It would have been faster to simply dial 911 herself and put the phone in her pocket and keep the line open.  Oh, knowing now what I find out later, why the hell isn’t the mom calling the police too, she knows he’s the freaking Butcher??  Also, interior bathroom door that unlocks with a key??\n\n1:11:23 – Cooper shows us Spencer is already gone.  Super great response time, seeing how his general location was derived less than 3 minutes ago.  Wow, that’s on the level of the Flash or Quicksilver… is this a Marvel movie?  Maybe this is in the Unbreakable universe and there’s another hero out there that Lady Raven’s fan just happens to be related to… It could happen.\n\n1:12:55 – Lady Raven, “Cooper, enough of this foolishness.”  Oh, that’s gonna make him think twice.  Saleka obviously gets her acting chops from her old man.  Just wow.  Maybe if she were a better actress, she could have convinced him she was his mother like she tried.  Or maybe, that’s why it didn’t work.  Lady Raven can’t act, and Saleka was doing a great job conveying that in her performance.  I’ll have to think on that one.\n\n1:14:20 – Mom knowingly puts both children in harm's way by having them all stand in front of the car.  Well, at what we find out later that isn’t so surprising.  Lady Raven just gets out of the car – crisis averted.\n\n1:15:40 – SWAT and Dr. Grant show up.  Thankfully Lady Raven points to the house so they know where to go.\n\n1:16:25 – Dr. Grant is giving instructions to SWAT as they surround the house, why?  How is the geriatric FBI profiler giving commands in a tactical situation to Philadelphia SWAT?\n\n1:17:05 – Cooper has a tunnel to the neighbor’s yard… of course he does.  I’m not even going to go into how hard and long that would take to build.  Have you ever dug a significant hole or trench in your yard?  It’s hard.  Plus, it would need supports, materials… quite a project that I would think the wife and neighbors might notice.  We hear that a SWAT member in a neighbor’s yard is down.  To this point, there has never been less than 5 or six SWAT members grouped together at any point in time.  Cooper found the rogue SWAT guy and took him out.  Doesn’t matter, you got like 30 SWAT there, start looking… get a K9… god…\n\n1:17:35 – Oh shit, Cooper’s the limo-driving SWAT guy!  I’m shocked!!  Forget that a SWAT guy shouldn’t have driven her anyway, but Super Coop took at the SWAT guy, changed and jumped in limo and drove away without anybody noticing.  Damn impressive.  Driver should be like, “Wait, what the hell that’s my job, get back here!!!”\n\n1:19:40 – Limo surrounded by fans, why doesn’t he just gently drive through them, he just sits there. \n\n1:19:57 – Police arrive in record time, looks to be the same group that was just at Cooper’s house.  Seconds later Cooper has already (not necessarily in this order) exited the driver’s side, changed clothes, erected a fake SWAT driver and pressed through all those people without being noticed.   SWAT immediately and completely surrounds the people surrounding the limo, pointing their rifles directly at them.  SWAT = Special Weapons and Tactics, yet none of them have any muzzle awareness at ALL.  Without given a command, random SWAT guy starts shooting out tires with civilians and other SWAT in perfect crossfire positions.  What happened to spike strips around a stopped vehicle?  I only watch YouTube videos and even I know that’s what should be used here, SWAT my ass.  Jeez, someone def got a ricochet strike.  Again, without a command, several shoot the fake driver Cooper had time to erect.  Those bullets gonna go somewhere, hate to be the folks standing directly on the other side of that car.\n\n1:21:35 – Lady Raven for some reason is driven straight to meet Quicksilver and his niece and Spencer to get hugs.  Thank god that was the only blue door in sight…\n\n1:23:05 – Cooper’s wife decides to stay at home all alone.  Oh wait, there’s going to be 2 police cruisers out front, that’s comforting.  Maybe keep someone at the tunnel entrance?  We see surveillance video of Spencer’s abduction, was that how they saw Cooper’s tattoo?  You’ve GOT to be kidding me.  Enhance! Enhance!\n\n1:26:20 – The big reveal.  Cooper’s wife found that damn paper ticket receipt in his billfold.  HIS BILLFOLD!  What guy keeps ANY receipt much less for a concert and in his freakin wallet?!  Plus, the biggest dumbest part of this entire movie… WHAT MOTHER KNOWINGLY SENDS HER DAUGHTER OUT WITH HER SERIAL KILLER DAD ALONE!!  Oh wait, let’s alert the police so they send SWAT and guns and all too!!! Yeh, that’s a great plan, better than calling them secretly and getting your family away from him… good god…\n\n1:28:09 – Let’s have pie before you kill us.\n\n1:31:20 – I found your bag and poisoned your pie ‘cause I planned this all out.  Knew you can’t refuse pie…\n\n1:33:44 – Sorry, not poison.  Just some drug Cooper used to calm his victims, which must have the exact opposite effect on him ‘cause he was able to power through 2 stun gun charges before attacking SWAT guy and throwing him to the ground and gouging out his eyes. Finally taking two more charges, the final one from super profiler Dr. Grant before knocking him to the ground.  That’s a good drug. \n\nSo why is the old lady profiler even there at that point being involved in the take down??? Oh yeh, Cooper’s mommy issues, he needed closure. Scene ends with 6 SWAT members standing over Cooper who’s laid out on the floor – none are attempting to cuff him or anything.  If they’re not careful, they’ll all turn around and he’ll disappear again.\n\n1:34:57 – Cooper’s walk out of the house.  First, his hands are not cuffed behind him.  He’s being escorted by 4 useless SWAT officers who, when he stops for a second, one raises their AR, chambers a round (lol) and points it at him point blank… along with the other 2 SWATs behind him (muzzle awareness!!).  So, you elect to use tasers when Cooper’s running free like a mad man, but in chains you’re going to threaten him with deadly force?  Of course, they let him ‘have a sec’ to straighten the bike on the lawn.  They’ve been continually shown this guy’s victims and how dangerous he is, he just gouged out your buddy's eyes, but yeh, cut him some slack and let him have a moment with his kid’s bike.  Right.  We find out later he’s able to yank a spoke off the wheel of the bike with no tools and little to no effort.  What a cheap piece of crap bike Coop bought his kid.  Oh, on that note too.  How long has this bike been out on the lawn?  Riley is long past the point she’d ever be seen dead on a pink bike with a basket and yellow pom poms on the handles.\n\nSo, Dr. Grant is still giving orders here and telling SWAT to let Riley go so she can hug her dad one last time.  Stupid, wouldn’t happen.  Not even going to ask how the kids got back from the sister’s so fast, do they live down the block?  If so, would they have even been safe there to begin with?  I mean, if I’m Cooper I’m going straight to the sister’s house, taking Riley and her brother and skipping town.\n\nThis whole sequence is stupid.  Anybody that’s watched a taser deployment on YouTube knows what would have happened.  Once Coop hit the ground every officer in eye shot would have pounced on him and he’d have been cuffed from behind and dragged straightway to the car/van.  He would have been searched before putting him in there (as policy goes), hence the bike spoke would have been discovered even if they’d of let him stupidly mess with the bike.\n\n1:37:54 – Cooper picks the cuff lock with the bike spoke and smiles like he’s won or suddenly free or something.  Soooo, how does he get out of the van?  I’m pretty sure they drive those things straight to a massive garage which is locked before opening.  We all know there’s gonna be about 50 SWAT guys there for the opening.  Yay, you picked the lock Coop, you can freely scratch your sack on the way to prison.\n\nTHE END (except for mid credit stinger where nothing stupid actually happens, yay)\n\nIf you made it to here, wow… thanks!  I enjoyed Trap much better the second time through writing this all out.  It’s now one of those ‘so bad it’s good’ movies for me.",

After Swagger gets his answer about paper patching, he then says I have another question and Mister Rate says \"I thought you might\". This is what leads me to believe he knows it's Swagger, and then his confirmation is when he checks the calluses on Swagger's palm.\n4. Swagger asks Rate about the Cold Bore shot, and Rate then says something about how he heard of a man who did it (Bob Lee Swagger) but didn't know because he never met him.\n   1. Is the shot he is referring to Swagger's shot at the can of stew?\n5. Additionally, Rate says something like that would have been a bad job to take because whoever took it is probably dead. Is Rate referring to the \"job\" the colonel approached Swagger with?If so how does he know about Swagger's initial encounter with the colonel and his associates?\n6. Lastly, Swagger asks Rate if there is another guy who could take that shot and concludes it was the man in the wheelchair. Is Swagger just asking generally if there is another marksman he knows of who has the skill to perform a shot like this or is Swagger asking about a specific shot?\n7. What do they mean by the bullet was a metallurgical match? They mention something like the bullet was mangled or something? Does this imply the bullet was too destroyed to test it?\n8. Lastly Swagger burns the audio recording and I understand why he does that, but why does he say \"Im saving our lives...This stuffs plutonium, nobody can handle it without getting killed\"Why would that get them killed knowing that info and by whom? Other associates of the colonel?\n\nThank you!",

I thought everything was going well, it feels triumphant... until the Sound of Silence begins playing again just before it really ends. And that song at that particular moment and Dustin Hoffman's ending just tells you that something is wrong but you don't what and it's just unnerving. \n\nWhat other movies have the same kind of ending? I have seen some movies produce the effect but take a longer time. Nocturnal Animal's restaurant scene comes to mind where the simple fact that nothing is happening on-screen just creeps you out",

For a class project, I am trying to curate a small database of non-English and non-Bengali film clips that display particular emotions. These clips will be used as background for certain memory recall experiments.   \n  \nThe clips should have a duration of about 5 to 30 seconds and shall not have more than two characters (preferably one); one of the characters shall express the emotion. The list of emotions is as follows:\n\n1. Affection\n2. Confusion\n3. Contemplation\n4. Contempt\n5. Curiosity\n6. Determination\n7. Disappointment\n8. Disinterest\n9. Embarrassment\n10. Enthusiasm\n11. Gratitude\n12. Guilt\n13. Hope\n14. Jealousy\n15. Nervousness\n16. Pride\n17. Regret\n18. Relief\n19. Suspicion\n20. Sympathy\n\nI request the community to suggest any film scene that comes to your mind, if possible, with a rough timestamp and link to access (Mubi, Kanopy, etc.) I understand that the choice of scenes will be a subjective judgment, and often, a single scene will portray overlapping emotions. However, we believe that those will not be a hindrance to our experiment.  \n  \nThanks in advance! The help of the community will be highly appreciated.",

The winner of the vote is a movie that - as far as I can see - has never received any distribution beyond the German-speaking countries (I'm happy to be convinced otherwise if I've misread imdb) and and as if that wasn't enough, the film also has various German-language titles: It was called *Der Wunderpfarrer* in Austria, *Ein wunderbarer Sommer* in (West) Germany and, last, but not least, ***Kinder der Berge*** in Liechtenstein.\n\nI'm thrilled that a film from a previously very neglected era has won. At the same time, there are only 4 ratings on Letterboxd for this work from 1958. Well, no matter what: It was a fun round with a lot of humor and creativity and I'm looking forward to seeing how it continues now that we're looking at **Lithuania**. For the few of you who are new here, I would like to explain the rules once again:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions . maybe yours will be even the one that ends up on [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)!\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Straume (engl.: Flow)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "selftext": "Hi \n\nI'm a film student and I'm desperately looking for a file-manager-application as an alternative of the poor design of Windows' file explorer (which only supports categorization as its method of organising files).\nSpecifically, I want to store there my collection of downloaded movies and have the ability to sort them by tags as well as other meta data (info about director, age, etc)\nI would love if it had a nice and simplistic interface which make it easy to use and organise.\nI know I have put many demands on the table but I let put all of them in the case that anything exists as close to that as possible.\n\nFor a cinephile that wants to organise his movie library, I don't think it's too much to ask.\n\nSo, any suggestions ?\n",

        "selftext": ">!I dont know if someone has said this before but whatever this is my take. I think that the whole ending dream life sequence starts off from her perspective. She is the one leading around the fantasy world, her show is full of people cheering, she gets the acting job, goes to Paris and is successful, all while Seb is just there along with her. He doesnt open a club, or really follow his dream, he is just there. The second half of the dream life is Seb's, because to me SEBS DREAM LIFE BECAME HER!! In that part, he is just with her, and they start a family, and are perfect together. He doesnt care about the jazz anymore because she became what he wanted instead. That is why he walks past his car in the beginning to walk with her to her car, or why he picks up the gig so that he can support them because he heard Mia talking to her mom on the phone saying he was gonna find a job.  That is why he is so supportive of her getting the role in Paris (and all throughout the movie), because he loves her and wants her to succeed as part of his dream life. I think that is also why they fight at dinner, because Mia thinks hes giving up on his dream to own a jazz club when really his dream became her, and it felt like he was being betrayed by her. I hope someone can agree because in my mind this makes perfect sense.!<",

Is there a slight chance that Jack could have actually gotten Rose pregnant when they made love in the back of that car? Or would the freezing cold water of the Atlantic ocean done too much damage to her internals causing the pregnancy not to work? Also, why were there no records of Jack at all? I get that there wouldn't have been any records of him for the actual Titanic voyage itself because he won his ticket in a poker game and didn't actually pay for it himself through White Star Line, but surely if Brock, Bodine and his crew dug a little deeper, they could have found SOMETHING on him like a birth certificate or anything dating back pre April of 1912.\n\nOh and by the way, did anyone look at Rose in that movie and believe for a second that she was supposed to be 17? Kate Winslet herself was 22 when the film came out. For a 17 year old to be matched/married off to someone like Cal who if we go by how old Billy Zane himself was at the time which was 31, that is just profoundly and objectively creepy, even for 1912.",

        "selftext": "All the movies I can find never show the event, the most well known movie with Nick cage barley shows what happened on new york, cause there underground during the majority of the film.\n\nThe other movies show what happen on the plane but don't show what happens in the city or in the towers. I know there's one with Charlie sheen but he's in the elvator the entire time. \n\nI always thought it would be good to make a movie about that day with true stories about people on that day. Focusing on multiple people, like fire fighters, workers who were in the building and reporters. To only be in New york and not focus on other locations. \n\nI think this would be a great movie done right. I know people say \"we shouldn't make a movie about a serious topic\" but what about war movies or movies about the holocaust? Just because it's a movie doesn't make it entertainment, it can be a story to show people this did happen and to show the event better then any camrea footage.\n\nTo show how it was a normal day and then everything falls apart and turns to chaos when the towers are hit and at the end we see where the towers stood and see nothing. It could impact the viewer, especially people who weren't around during 9/11 to get the same impact people felt when they saw it on TV. \n\nThis would also be good for fire fighters, so people know how heroic they are. To see what they went though going in and out of the towers and to see the inside of the towers one last time before there gone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit:  I feel like alot of the people don't want this movie made, where the people who saw it on tv but think of the future and the people who didn't see it on tv. A movie like this can show the true stories of people who survived it and make the audience who see it look more into the event. This can also be accurate cause alot of the other 9/11 films don't really look accurate when you compare it to the footage from that day. ",

I'm still not clear on how Dodo was not affected by the curse until Ronan tries to gain custody of her again and after she teaches Dodo about her real name. Did Ronan pass the curse onto Dodo so the curse on herself would be diluted and then later proceed to regret her actions because she starts loving Dodo? Was Ronan even cursed in the first place, before even watching the tunnel video in the hospital?\n3. Does it mean that Ronan had deliberately showed people the video so she would be temporarily spared by the effects of the curse (her parents, the police officers, Ms Hsieh the CPS lady)?",

Nowadays, it seems like it’s usually mentioned in reference to Lawrence’s (admittedly excellent) breakout performance.

        "title": "3 twist villains I think are well written vs 3 I that I think aren’t ",
        "selftext": "Spoilers for Legally Blonde, Monsters Inc., Glass Onion, Zootopia, Suicide Squad (2016), and Iron Man 3:\n\nWell Written:\n\nCallahan - Legally Blonde: Callahan starts out as a role model and mentor. He is skilled in law which gains him Elle’s respect. He is also one of the only two people she feels believes in her at Harvard after he accepted her into his internship program. Callahan doesn’t start the movie off as completely moral either though, he shows that he is willingly to cross lines in court and is out for himself not his clients. These points are perfectly emphasized in his song “Blood in the Water” in the musical adaptation of the movie. Callahan’s twist is so good because it’s believable. He’s not an over the top or cartoonish villain, his type of villain is one that we find in everyday life. He manipulates those around him in a convincing and relatable manner.\n\nMister Waternoose - Monsters Inc.: We know that Mister Waternoose is in the wrong early on in the movie, but we think that he is oblivious to this. He is portrayed to us as a kind man who cares for his employees and acts as a father figure to them. His twist is impactful highly because of how it affects the other characters in the movie. When he reveals his true priorities and banishes Sulley and Mike is when we see Sulley truly break. He has been separated from Boo by the man he saw as a father and aspired to be like. We also see the similarities between Mike and Waternoose reach its peak, Mike now knows humans aren’t toxic yet he still wants to go back and continue the life him and Sulley had before they met Boo. \n\nMiles Bron - Glass Onion: Miles is presented to us a narcissistic man with a lack of originality and smarts which is exactly what he turns out to be. His twist is hidden in plain sight throughout the whole movie but just like the characters we don’t realize because of his grand gestures and facades. He used his charm to get into a position of power and now used that power selfishly and to manipulate others exactly like many real life business men and politicians. \n\nOverall: These twist villains are scarily relatable and charismatic. They have an air of respect to them and are seen as role models to the general public of their worlds. They exhibit hints at their true selves throughout their films, but are able to manipulate not only the characters but also the audience into forgetting about these flaws. \n\nPoorly Written:\n\nDawn Belleweather - Zootopia: Belleweather had the opportunity to be a good twist villain. She had a viable motif and compared/contrasted well with the protagonist, Judy Hopps. Where Belleweather failed was screen time and dialogue. She only had around 5 minutes towards the end of the film to be a villain which gave her limited development and an all around rushed feeling. Her dialogue was bland and felt like it could be shoved into any other movie.  \n\nAmanda Waller - Suicide Squad (2021): With limited screen time her twist wasn’t impactful in any sense. Her motif of being willing to sacrifice people for the greater good felt one note and over done. The movie’s twist would have felt more important with just Peacemaker as the twist villain. \n\nTrevor Slattery - Iron Man 3: Slattery is one of the most hated on twist villain characters and for good reason. The movie built up to the reveal of a character fans already love from the comics and left them feeling dissatisfied with a cop out villain. He had no qualities to make the audience enjoy his character.\n\nOverall: Twist villains with overdone or one note motifs tend to feel bland and weakly developed. The lack of screen time for most of these villains is their biggest downfalls. They aren’t sympathetic enough for us to feel for them and aren’t menacing enough for us to fear them.",

        "selftext": "I was a huge World War I nerd in high school, spurred by our teacher showing us films like Gallipoli, Legends of the Fall, and A Very Long Engagement. Leading up to the 2014 centennial of the outbreak of World War I, I was very excited to get a whole new crop of films about the war, especially internationally.\n\nBut I ended up surprised and disappointed at the paltry number of films we did get. The biggest to be released in the US, *1917*, wasn't even released until after the centennial was over; ditto the recent *All Quiet On The Western Front*. Wikipedia's [list of World War I films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_I_films?wprov=sfla1) has only about a dozen titles worldwide for the whole 2014-2018 period.\n\nWhy do you think we didn't see more World War I films released during the centennial years? Is the war simply too remote now? Are war films not as popular or financially successful as they used to be? Is it even that there are so many conflicts and so much instability worldwide these days that audiences would rather not see that in their films as well?",

        "title": "\"The Grey\" is a timeless classic on survival and acceptance",
        "selftext": "\"One must imagine sisyphus happy\"\n\nThe film itself is incredibly nihilistic with all the characters dying without much meaning to their death. But it is a realistic portrayal of death of how sudden it strikes. It is in contrast to heroic death scenes of profound meaning in the majority of other films.\n\nThe first death scene is a cinematic masterpiece, arguably one of the most intimate portrayals of death in film history and I do not know of many other movies that have reached that level of intimacy with death. People also did not like it for its use of tropes-but I personally think a movie can use all the tropes they want as long as the execution is excellent enough to have us fully invested in each scene, forgetting about tropes. The whispers of comfort, the stages of grief and the score in the background. It was such a tender and raw scene.\n\nI understand many people do not like the movie for their depiction of wolves (they also do not like it because of the false advertising of an ending scene but I will not fault the movie itself for its bad marketing strategy). Its like another \"Jaws\" misrepresentation of an animal for allegorical effect. The shark being alcoholism. The wolves being death.\n\nThe wolves are not just wild animals; they function as a metaphor for death itself. Death is not depicted as a peaceful or calm transition but as a relentless, angry force. The wolves are hungry, aggressive, and invasive, much like the way death often feels—unpredictable and overwhelming. We either fight it in the end or let ourselves accept our eventual oblivion. It is an embrace of the chaos and brutality of simply being alive in the first place. It shows nature's indifference to whatever meaning any of the characters had, because it in the end everyone dies. There is no encore, there might be a struggle and fight but we return the dust no matter what. It shows nature, and death within it, remains indifferent to any meaning we try to impose on our lives. Regardless of the struggles, aspirations, or dreams the characters had before the crash, in the end, they are all reduced to the same fate.\n\nIn the end it represents moving forward for the sake of moving forward. The other characters had something to get back but Liam Neeson didn't. Meaning is flexible, it has no inherent meaning until we reach out for the illusion of life and find grace in our brutal survival. It is an acceptance of it and so the movie is very stoic. It is what it is, go with the flow with nature's chaos.\n\nWhich brings me to the music, it is somber/euphoric/calm which is in direct contrast to the suicidality of the main character, and the utter violence of the rest of the film. It seems like even with all the brutality, there is beauty and tranquility in the chaos. It could also be a representation of the calming of his wife, lamenting her soothing existence over the deaths. It also has an epic factor as we brace ourselves for the worst. The music is deep and has memory in its notes, memories of our life before we finally perish.\n\nThe brutality of the film serves as a great equalizer, stripping the characters of their identities and reducing them to their basic, primal instincts. The wolves’ aggression and the harsh environment strip away everything but the will to survive. This return to the raw, animalistic side of human nature is where the film’s true power lies.\n\nIt feels refreshing to see how raw the movie portrays its theme of community in hardship, and the finalization of death.",

        "title": "Monsieur Verdoux by Charles Chaplin - A film unlike anything Chaplin had made before. We have a black comedy.",
        "selftext": "Throughout history, Charlie Chaplin's heroes have done many good deeds: saving people's lives, risking their lives for others, helping others, etc. But in this film he has a completely different role. He plays a swindler and wife-killer who is ready to do anything for money. Quite unexpected, isn't it? Especially for such a person. \"Monsieur Verdoux.\" Charles's second all-sound film. It's not like all his other films, I mean, you can already feel Chaplin's fatigue, given the number of films he created. But this film hasn't lost much. It's also dramatic, funny and interesting. Only there was more drama, the humor became a little \"darker\", the music became sadder, but the \"interesting\" remained the same. After all, this is Chaplin and he can't make a bad film. \n\nAfter the advent of sound in cinema, which \"killed\" everyone's favorite little tramp, Charles needed to create a new image that would be just as memorable. This was followed by the Jewish barber from The Great Dictator, and then by Monsieur Verdoux, who is completely different from the poor, poorly dressed tramp. Verdoux is a fairly wealthy, well-mannered and educated person, who can be somewhat cruel, and he can't even be cruel! After all, he is a real criminal. And while watching the film we are even sad, because we will not see that Tramp again, his incredible actions, facial expressions, and walk. Charles Chaplin did in his life what modern actors have not been able to do to this day. He acted like no one else, made films like never before. He managed to combine comedy with drama, where the audience cried and laughed at the same time. And in this film he played the same... And although here he chose a negative character for himself, when watching the film for some reason you start to sympathize with him, you feel sorry for him. I can't even explain why, but that's how things are. It is a sign of skill when an actor makes you sympathize with one of his characters. The final scene of the film is simply magnificent, perhaps it is worth watching this film just for that.\n\nDespite some genuinely comical scenes, the speech that Verdoux makes gives its deeper message - Verdoux was in it for the money. To him, the women were business propositions to be exploited. His point is that what he has done on a smaller scale is being done by dictators worldwide; people are not treated as human beings but merely for economic gain, for power and for exploitation. Though Verdoux's argument doesn't absolve him of responsibility or justify his actions, the warning is a good one - people need to care more about each other and about what's going on in their world, and put their attention on really important matters like suppression of the masses. Why, he asks, are the headlines full of Verdoux and not of what is going on around the world? (The film's ending takes place in 1937.) \n\n  \nLove in this Chaplin film is not as simple as in his previous works. The main love of his life completely captured his heart and mind, pushing him to terrible acts and justifying them as necessity, the only way out. But by chance Verdoux finds a tragic example of the same love he lives for. The young and beautiful actress Marilyn Nash, in the image of a simple girl, finds the key to the protagonist's humanity. She, having appeared in several scenes, perhaps has the greatest influence on his feelings, and opens his eyes to many things. The intense tragedy of one man becomes the pain of many over time. And these few comic moments only provoke an ironic smile, as they mock the image of Charlie Chaplin, showing that he cannot go unpunished. You have to pay for everything.",

I enjoy every series and I like and can enjoy every movie from the slow paced motion picture and seeking god in V to the highs of Khan and First Contact and the rebooted Kelvin timeline but I have a tough time with Generations.\n\nIMO every decision and choice was just a big mistake from\n\n* Getting a TV director who never made a movie before to direct.\n* Insulting cameos for the original cast (Nichelle Nichols and Nimoy said no) and their absence was hidden from the TNG cast who were understanding the full original cast would participate. (\\*my friend worked on it , he's in opening credits, and said Paramount didn't want to pay Nichelle enough that's why she said no and said that Paramount was cheap about everything)\n* The ultimate crazy mistake being Kirk's fantasy life in the Nexus is not reuniting with his dead son or having another chance at raising him with Carol (his personal arc in the original movies but studio execs said NO to this)... but instead some romp with a girl named Antonia on a horse.\n* Plus killing Kirk. The studio told Shatner they were doing it with or without him. So even though famously in Khan he says he knows he's going to die alone... he instead dies stupidly under a bridge collapse looking at Picard.\n* The writers were the same as First Contact and Ron Moore created Battlestar Galactica but him and Brannon Braga were under Paramount's strict thumb and weren't free to make anything they wanted. Plus they had a timetable they were on.\n\nIf you see a theme here it's that Paramount and execs were the true villains ultimately...\n\nBut letting all that go, I usually like to focus on the good. So here it goes:\n\n* The nexus is actually a cool idea. An alternate universe (that's akin to addiction) that creates a reality of anything you want.\n* The Klingon bosommy Duras sisters. (needed more to do though)\n* The crash of the Enterprise looked nice.\n* Using Data's emotion chip another good idea though executed badly.\n* Malcolm Mcdowell plays a descent obsessed villain.\n* Cameron from Ferris Bueller is in it.\n* Shatner's final line is kinda haunting... \"Oh my\"\n* BEST THING: to this day when toast pops up I point and grunt \"mmm\"\n\nMy what's bad about it list is much longer but I'm trying to be positive.",

        "title": "The End of Evangelion - A layered Japanese animation that addresses social isolation and the fear of interacting with other people.",
        "selftext": "In the world of Neon Genesis Evangelion, humans are descendants of a super-being called Lilith. Both the original series finale and the film revolve around an apocalyptic event called the Human Instrumentality, which merges all humans with Lilith into a single consciousness. Different factions in Evangelion want to bring about the Human Instrumentality for different reasons throughout the series. In short, at both the series finale and the end of Evangelion, the Human Instrumentality begins, and at its center is the protagonist Shinji Ikari.\n\nThe first part of the film takes an intense turn, with Rei rejecting Gendo's plan and merging with Lilith, while the Seele organization initiates Third Impact. Shinji, still inside Unit-01, is confronted with the hybrid form of Rei and Lilith, and the vision leaves him in despair. Eventually, he is pierced by the Spear of Longinus, transforming Unit-01 into the Tree of Life.\n\nMeanwhile, Shinji begins to hallucinate, and the audience is taken inside his mind, where he deals with his emotional self-destruction and memories of past rejections. The series of visions culminates with Shinji asking why reality is so painful, and Rei responds that fantasy does not solve his problems. Here, the film explores the central theme of escaping reality and accepting that, despite its hardships, reality is something that must be faced.\n\nOne of the most talked-about sequences in the film is when the animation gives way to live-action footage, showing a movie theater and a Japanese city. In this scene, Shinji reflects on his inability to understand reality, and Rei suggests that he is using fantasy as a form of escape. This scene highlights the idea that, while other worlds are possible, losing oneself in fantasy does not solve real-life problems. Interestingly, this sequence also includes images of Rei dolls in theater seats, alluding to the fine line that many anime fans walk between reality and fantasy. By the end of the film, Shinji rejects the idea of ​​merging with all human souls and decides that, despite the pain and suffering, it is worth continuing to exist as an individual. This decision culminates in the iconic scene in which he wakes up on a beach next to Asuka. In one of the most debated moments in anime history, Shinji strangles Asuka, seeking confirmation that he is truly back in reality. When she touches his face, he realizes that she is real, and begins to cry, as she calls him “disgusting.”\n\nThis scene reflects Shinji’s desire to exist in the real world, even at the risk of rejection. Metaphorically, it is also a reminder that human interactions, with all their complexities and difficulties, are what give life meaning, reinforcing the message that isolation and escaping into fantasy are empty paths.\n\nIn the end, The End of Evangelion shows that change is difficult and painful, but necessary. Although Shinji has rejected Instrumentality and saved the souls of humanity, he is still a broken person, and the road to recovery will be long. Asuka’s decision to offer compassion instead of condemnation suggests that despite all the hardships, there is a chance for redemption and building a new status quo, if everyone keeps trying.\n\nThe film's conclusion is deliberately dark and uncertain, reflecting the creators' intention to show that there are not always easy happy endings, and that personal growth is a long and often painful process.\n\nLife has pain, life has suffering, life has disappointment, but it also has its moments of joy.\n\nHomer in the Iliad reminds us that life alternates between good and bad times.\n\n\"On the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.\"\n\nShinji can, even if slowly, open up to other people. It's good that the film doesn't have that typical happy ending, but it can show us that there can be hope.\n\nShinji is more similar to Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment than being a shounen hero like Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hakusho.\n\nI didn't like the ending of the manga written by Sadamoto, because the world restarts, no one remembers anything and learns from the lessons of the past to evolve.",

        "selftext": "Earlier this year, I watched Gladiator from Sir Ridley Scott for the very first time. I thought it would be a good idea to utilize the longest version available for that occasion. Now, to prepare for Gladiator II, I decided to re-watch the original movie and give the theatrical cut a shot.\n\nAs it turns out, that one works better for me. A tight cut with a fast pace, a steady flow and the ability to know when to use Commodus and when to stop digging into his character. Yes, Commodus is an interesting villain, that develops very fluidly in his behaviour throughout the movie. No, that does not mean I need additional footage of him to gain more, mostly not very notable, details about his descent into madness. \n\nThe theatrical cut does not forget that, while being a movie of epic and visually spectacular proportions, it's a revenge tale and at its core not much more. A tale busy with keeping the social aspect of Maximus' success very much alive, without kneeling into it so deep that the next scene has to dig it outta the void of needless dialogues.\n\nWith everything more concentrated, tight and back-to-back, I, surprisingly, found myself much more invested into the ending. I think it's because the theatrical cut is more about Maximus, the  warrior and less about Maximus, the human. \n\nAt the end of the day, I guess both cuts of Gladiator have their right to exist. But for me, the theatrical one felt way better. 150 minutes just flew by.",

        "selftext": "Why Doesn’t Anyone Talk About Nicolas Winding Refn?\n\nI rarely hear Nicolas Winding Refn mentioned when people talk about great directors, and honestly, it feels like a huge oversight. He’s made some truly fantastic films and even an incredible miniseries, but for some reason, his name doesn’t seem to come up nearly as often as it should. Sure, not all of his movies are perfect—no director’s filmography is—but his best work stands out as bold, stylish, and unique in ways a lot of other directors don’t even attempt.\n\nTake Drive, for example. It’s practically iconic at this point, with its mix of neon-soaked visuals, minimalist storytelling, and that killer soundtrack. But beyond that, Only God Forgives, Bronson, and The Neon Demon all have such a distinct voice. They might not be for everyone, but you can’t deny they’re his. And then there’s Too Old to Die Young, which is basically like a 13-hour fever dream. It’s challenging, yeah, but also pretty mesmerizing if you stick with it.\n\nSo, why isn’t Refn talked about more? Is it because his style is so polarizing? Do people write him off as “style over substance”? Or is it just that his projects don’t have the same cultural staying power as some of his peers?\n\nI’d love to hear from other people on this. Are you a fan of his work? Do you think he’s underrated, or do you feel like he gets the attention he deserves? Let’s discuss!",

        "selftext": "I mean, I was never a aficionado of Joel Schumacher's take on Batman. Schumacher was inspired more by the camp value of the 60s Batman series in comparison with Tim Burton's Frank Miller-ian vision. \n\n\nIt didn't work. The leather suit with the nipples seemed more like something out of an S&M gay dark club fetish, Robin was a pouting purple cliché. The villains were a mixed bag: Tommy Lee Jones was completely lost and didn't get what made Two Face different. Jim Carrey was more effective as the Riddler, even if he was essentially playing Ace Ventura in a green body suit and a Annie Lennox haircut. \n\nNicole Kidman would have been the perfect casting for Poison Ivy. Instead, Joel Schumacher made her into a gay male in a woman's body: constantly horny with a leather fetish, unisex name, is a district attorney who boxes in her office. The gay subtext and context sees whar Schumacher was trying to convey, especially when Kidman's character is the dominant one who assumes the male pursuer role. She's essentially trying to top Batman for most of the film. \n\nI missed the darker tone of the Tim Burton's films. They had a edge and knew how to value the kitsch with the grit. Burton could go over the top with the Christmas sets and decoration yet also have the Penguin be almost as scary as the clown from the Terrifier films. The nose scene from Batman Returns? \n\nPlus, Val Kilmer as Batman? I didn't see it. Michael Keaton was the perfect Batman. Kilmer was a twink, I couldn't take Kilmer seriously as Bruce Wayne.",

Kubrick is no saint (especially with the whole Full Metal Jacket & A Clockwork Orange BTS fiasco) but I think this man made two of the best films in the history of cinema.

She did the best she could do to make up for not being able to save her brother, by trying to save the one person he truly loved.\n\nThe binging scene is absolute brilliance. I did not find it disgusting. It gave light to the fact that while Charlie was capable of finding a silver lining with anyone and everyone (even Thomas who accused him for Alan's death), his self loathing was inherent to an extent where just a look from a stranger (Dan) was enough for him to dive into the one thing he knew will kill him, even when he was already dying. Just for a few seconds of temporary dopamine.\n\nTh essay being written by Ellie was chef's kiss. The broken plate's significance was amazing as well. The scene with his online students could have dwelled deeper.\n\nI do not think the climax actually happened. Given that it was sunny on just that day and he was able to get up on his own. I think Ellie stormed out and Charlie died, or imagined the climax in his dying moments.\n\nThe only thing that didnt sit well with me was Thomas's portrayal. It was out rightly homophobic and the only explanation was religion. The blame on religion was too blatant, could have been a bit subliminal, given that both Charlie and Alan actually had copies of Bible with them. I guess that was because it was Idaho which is republican? I am not from the States, neither I am a Christian, so I may not have understood it well.\n\nAnd of course, special mention to the best of all, \"I need to know that I have done one thing right with my life\".",

        "selftext": "First, the film uses the cliché of fire arrows in battle. When they would be used to burn down a city and not in a humid forest.\n\nThe film comes with the anachronism that Emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to restore the Roman Republic that died under Julius Caesar.\n\nCommodus was angered because his father named Maximus emperor and assassinated him in a not so subtle way. This could have led to Commodus being executed by the soldiers, as happened with the usurper Avidius Cassius.\n\nMarcus Aurelius is not Caligula or Nero, he is a popular emperor and the way Commodus killed him, it can be seen that his own son killed him and he may end up being executed.\n\nMarcus Aurelius is not Caligula or Nero, he is a popular emperor and the way Commodus killed him, it can be seen that his own son killed him and he may end up being executed.\n\nAnthony Mann's film The Fall of the Roman Empire was much more subtle, and Marcus Aurelius was poisoned, just like Emperor Claudius. When Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard, there should be the cliché that he is able to kill his captors and escape. The guards are always incapable, and the prisoner escapes.\n\nMaximus' wife and son are Roman citizens and could never be crucified. The crucifixion could happen in the Legion, but there was a special rule there. And they exaggerated the villainy of the emperor. The villain always has to be exaggerated. When his sister Lucilla conspires against him, Commodus does not kill his nephew and brother-in-law.\n\nAnd when Maximus exposes himself and tells everyone in the arena who he is, Commodus could simply arrest and execute him or poison him.\n\nThe downfall of the protagonist cannot be left out of the film.\n\nI liked that The Fall of the Roman Empire avoided being overly attractive and melodramatic like Gladiator. And Livius was never a slave.\n\nAnd the film cannot miss a final duel, as if Emperor Commodus would expose himself in this situation. This reminds me of the horrible Empire (2005) in which there was a duel between Augustus and Mark Antony. Augustus was never stupid enough to expose himself in a personal duel.\n\nCommodus was assassinated. As happened with Caligula, Galba, Domitianus. The gladiator Narcissus strangled him for money. Not that cliché of revenge.\n\nThere are no more compulsive stories in which people act out of greed. There always has to be that Manichaeism and a final duel.\n\nThe film abuses clichés and melodrama. And preferably there has to be revenge involving the family. Empire (2005), the Gladiator Tyranus was looking for his family. Gladiator, unfortunately, ended up generating imitations.  \n",

        "title": "It’s time to say our farewells to 24fps",
        "selftext": "For decades much of the populace has exhibited signs of collective denialism when it comes to 24 fps. Despite literally every 24fps panning shot ever made looking like certified freeze dried dogshit, old guard cinephiles have tragically maintained their untenable position of its superiority. \n\nPromulgating a variety of complaints against higher frame rates, each more absurd than the last, modern proponents of 24 FPS now more closely resemble religious fanatics rather than the educated enthusiasts they purport to be. No, \"It looks like a soap opera\" is not an acceptable criticism of higher frame rates in 2024. In fact, it never was. Sure, upon initial viewing it is perfectly normal to register what you are seeing to something relatable, but that process should last seconds, perhaps minutes at most. Past this point however, no rational person should be saying to themselves \"gee I know I'm looking at Deadpool but I can't shake the feeling I'm watching Days of Our Lives.\"\n\nDigging deeper into the 24fps cult's playbook we can observe their claim that higher frame rates make things look too real, eject viewers from the cinematic magic and prohibit the suspension of disbelief considered so integral to the experience. With just the most gentle of examinations though, this argument crumbles. The additional info provided by 48 and 72 fps creates a more fluid, less choppy visual that results in a decidedly more vibrant stimulation that engages and draws in the viewer with some describing the intensity as dreamlike or akin to the effect one gets with an in-person live performance. A great example of this can be witnessed in Ahsoka during a scene where, while unconscious, she encounters Anakin. Using RIFE AI to simulate higher frame rates, the high fps versions absolutely blow the \"standard\" out of the water. Anakin looks like he's about to walk right through your tv/monitor. Whereas previously we were largely limited to a handful of movies like the Hobbit (natively produced in 48fps) and Gemini Man (120fps) for analysis, now we we can utilize RIFE AI or other similar high quality tools and examine any piece of media resulting in a vastly broader range of material.\n\nAnother easily debunkable \"complaint\" lobbed at HFR is that it diminishes special effects and makes obvious that characters are working on a set. Under scrutiny though, this simply doesn't hold up. None of the lovingly crafted sets in Andor look worse for wear in HFR, quite the opposite! Or take Rings of Power as another example. Regardless of how you feel about the series itself, there's no doubt in my mind that simulating a higher frame rate does nothing but enhance the gorgeous sets, intricate cgi and special effects. In contrast, the technically impressive panning shots of Eregion are greatly diminished with the juddery stuttery limitations of 24 fps. In 48 and higher though you get the feeling that you are floating on air as you transtion from the majesty of the castle town towards the impending doom of the Orcish legions across the water. Once the action kicks in higher fps again demonstrates its superior value. Instead of being deprived of key frames, you are subjected to a robust sensory feed that allows you to both better follow and be ensared into the scene as swings of the swords and flying arrows flow smoothly allowing your primal instincts to involuntarily react to the visual feast.\n\nBy no means are the benefits limited to action and panning though. Subtle facial movements or physical gestures during dialogue and closeups that are diminished or missed altogether at 24 fps are significantly more impactful at HFR as you are no longer being deprived of crucial frame data. Of course, an unfortunate consequence of this is that poorly acted scenes often appear more eggregious as the magnification does not discriminate. Some have advocated for variable frame rates but in my experience, sloshing back and forth between different rates is jarring and uncessary. As mentioned above, HFR's benefits apply to slower scenes and those involving dialogue just as much as they do for faster and more frentic ones. And even films from decades ago get new life breathed into them when viewed at HFR.\n\nIn summary, 24 fps is the new black and white: to be used primarily strategically and for effect and, on rare occasions, for an entire movie. Its time as an impediment to new presentations and styles cannot come to an end fast enough. I am extraodinarly confident that given an adjustment period of 72 hours, the overwhelming amount of content consumers will become hooked and come to rightly regard 24 fps as a relic from the past that has outstayed both its welcome and utility.\n\n* I realize that I have cited TV series like Andor and ROP as evidence but the benefits apply to movies all the same",

There's a montage of him searching the internet for information, and as ridiculous as it is, at one point he actually types in \"www.max.com\" to see if that leads to anything (gotta love 90s movie internet scenes). Obviously, back when the movie came out, there was no such thing as streaming services like HBO Max, but now there are, and Paramount Plus hosts all the MI movies, and I just find it kind of funny that they accidentally ended up in a situation where one of the most iconic movies on their platform contains what's essentially a product placement for their competition. Plus, does that mean HBO had to actually buy the \"max.com\" domain from Paramount? Because I was under the impression that if a movie contained a made-up URL, the producers of the movie had to actually buy that domain (usually it'll just redirect to a website advertising the movie). Although maybe the movie was old enough that Paramount no longer needed to own it, and HBO just snatched it up. Anyway, I'm probably the only person on earth who cares about this at all lol but I just found it amusing.",

It was written and directed by David Koepp, based on the novella Secret Window, Secret Garden by Stephen King,\n\nThe plot follows Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), a writer who has fallen into a deep depression after catching his wife Amy (Maria Bello) in bed with another man, initiating divorce proceedings. Mort goes to live in a secluded cabin by a lake in an attempt to find peace, but soon begins to be tormented by the mysterious John Shooter (John Turturro), who accuses him of having plagiarized one of his short stories. The situation becomes more threatening when Shooter begins to threaten the life of Mort and those around him if the author does not admit the plagiarism. Written and directed by David Koepp, Secret Window is largely a “one-man show” by Johnny Depp. This is a film in which much of the plot focuses on the protagonist facing his inner demons in a cabin. Even when an imminent threat emerges in the form of Shooter (played in a perfectly histrionic way by Turturro), Depp's character's solitude is still a great vehicle for the feeling of danger, since the villain's presence is felt much more than seen.\n\nSecret Window is about a man who begins to lose his sanity due to paranoia, both due to the hell that Shooter transforms his life into and due to the depression caused by the betrayal he suffered. But Johnny Depp, an actor known for playing strange characters, plays Mort in a slightly eccentric way; which ends up hindering the protagonist's dramatic progression a little, in my opinion. It could be argued that the work makes it clear how dominated by melancholy Mort is (the protagonist clearly spends his days on the couch, wearing a robe that is already starting to tear), but even so, the character's plunge into fear and madness seems a little problematic.\n\n\n\nJohn Turturro, in turn, brings to life the sinister John Shooter, using a strong Mississippi accent and a wide-brimmed hat to create a figure that, even though it flirts with caricature, remains threatening. Turturro's character leaves a strong enough impression in his first scene that Mort Rainey's fear of this man is completely understandable.",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI think at this point most people who regularly check the subreddit here will have realised: For more than three weeks now, once a day, I am asking you about your favorite movie set in a particular European country. I'm from Germany myself and I'm always amazed at how many great films there are, even in countries whose film industry I've sometimes never even heard of - as much as that puts me to shame. Yesterday was another case like that with Latvia, but I think the majority found a worthy movie that might even be in the Oscar race in 2025: ***Straume*** (engl.: *Flow*) even scored a double victory, as it was nominated in both the top comment *and* the runner-up.\n\nToday I would actually bet that it will be comparatively difficult to find many nominees at all. We come to **Liechtenstein** and honestly, I think it will be a big challenge just to find a single movie that is set here. But: I'm also very willing to be wrong. The only important thing is that you follow these two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions . maybe yours will be even the one that ends up on [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)!\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Straume (engl.: Flow)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italia - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

I've seen so many movies romanticize it and make it look \"'pretty\", but it's violent, disgusting, and often embarrassing.

I had a very severe eating disorder a couple years ago and often ENVY who I was before I recovered. I can't even look at photos from then- because a \"trigger\" for me isn't sadness or trauma, it's a DEEP resentment towards myself for recovering. I feel that I was \"better\" before I recovered, like that version was >!\"the most lovable part of me\". !<\n\nI hated that I, at 19, identified more with Elisabeth than Sue. I hated that I related to almost every second of the movie, and realized that I live my life a lot like Elizabeth.

To my surprise it is actually good, surprisingly good compared to what we are served now. I remembered when it did come out and how it was ~~basically~~ a flop grossing only $73 mill vs the $250 mill that it cost to make.\n\nIt is a beloved SciFi classic and often considered the template that most SciFi films/books are based off of. Not bad for something written in 1912. I can't help be see modern hits like Dune taking some inspiration from the books. It has all the elements that most audiences like and has CGI that holds its own.\n\nMy only critique is the characters lack depth. Aside from John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) himself, but the Sab Than (Dominic West) and Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) lack any depth beyond the obviously stated motivations throughout the film. Even Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) has more depth than the other two combined. But beyond this, the movie itself was good and I'd recommend a re-watch from anyone",

        "selftext": "Hello movie lovers, stumbled upon Dark Star in full on youtube and \"watched\" it, I use the \"\" because it was so dull and ridiculous I fast forwarded a lot of it, but I did watch the ending and a link to Ad Astra was perceived. Apparently this D -grade effort started as a University of Southern California student film produced from 1970 to 1972, it was gradually expanded to feature-length until it appeared at Filmex in 1974, and subsequently received a limited theatrical release in 1975 (wiki), so I'm am guessing that the space race and success of 2001 a Space Odyssey and lesser films like Silent Running (1972) were the motivating factor for this to be padded out and released. Amazingly, it was John Carpenter's directorial debut. Some say it's satire/comedy, but at any rate it's low budget special effects (beach ball for an alien), and complete lack of atmosphere doom this from the start.\n\nTo make it worse, the ideas seem derivative of other films, for example the HAL like AI of the ship, which for no logical is also placed into the bombs used to explode unstable planets (wtf, like exploding a planet is going to somehow make the solar system safer?), even though the ship is at the planet and can release it directly. Like in Dr Strangeglove the bomb also gets stuck in the bomb bay and has to be manually ejected. The sense of boredom and ship degradation in deep space is taken from Silent Running. Basically there is a lot more entertainment to be found in the many pulp fiction black and white movies of the 1950's/60s.\n\nThere is one final scene however that left me surprised, the doomed crew member falling towards the nearby planet (the one they were supposed to obliterate) grabs a passing hunk of debris and surfs it down towards the planet (don't worry he won't survive). Anyway that scene was perhaps recycled at the finale of Ad Astra when Pitt surfs the asteroid belt on some debris to get back to his ship.\n\nFunnily enough, when I googled that scene, a discussion from reddit/r/scifi came up and to quote one of the posters:\n\n>wedontlikespaces • 5y ago •\n\n>Ad Astra looks like a film students final project who somehow managed to get Brad Pitt to play a part and who decided to just write the plot himself, on the back of a napkin,10 minutes before they started filming.\n\nthen, maybe, perhaps, time is a flat circle.",

I know I’m far too late since the movies release (Goblet of Fire) but was any other Indian out there feeling completely gob-smacked at how awfully represented the identical Indian twins were in GOF? \n\nThere’s a Yule Ball Scene where Harry and Ronald simp-ishly struggle to lure on a dancing female partner, so the Harry Potter Director or maybe even J.K Rowling herself in the books written, make a mockery out of these Indian Twin Girls by making them the last resort out of all females, who have to beg Harry and Ronald to dance. It’s so obvious that the minds behind this movie and J.K Rowling herself was being racist and completely ignorant towards Indian culture. \n\nGiven British-born Indian’s take up such a large portion of England’s population as different ethnicities are concerned (as J.K Rowling should know), then how so the Director/ J.K Rowling or Costume Designer for the twins, thought it was a great idea to make Parvati and Padma wear the most basic type of Indian female attires (they’re called Lehenga’s), given it was a Ball scene!?.. Let alone degrade these twins by making them beg Harry and Ronald to dance with them, while the white female lead (Emma Watson) get offered to dance with a supposed attractive guy (Viktor Krum). \n\nJust in case the White people overruling the movie’s production as well as J.K Rowling didn’t know and were too ignorant to research (or intentionally did so), the attires they made the twins wear are degrading, since these are normal everyday attires women wear back in India for when they are doing chores at home. The actual Indian female attire’s have a beautiful patterns of embroidery and sequins on them; they should not have been so shockingly plain, especially given it was a Ball scene!!\n\nIt’s a real shame as I’m Indian myself and loved the Harry Potter series growing up, being of the same generation as the main characters but not only that, to add more insult to injury, let alone degrading their small-part appearances with garish outfits but making these Indian twin characters beg as well to dance with the lead-white male characters!?, being the last resort of females (who happen to be Indian) that no guy offered to dance with them!?!?)\n\nIt surprises me how there was never any uproar from the Indian community about this apart from maybe one propert article online, hence I felt the need to make a post here. I feel like Harry Potter’s Goblet of Fire Production Team and J.K Rowling are ignorant and racist. \n\nUPDATE: Why on earth do the People here in the bloody comment section so far keep diverting from the treatment of the twins!?

Every time I finish a movie, I immediately want to talk about it with people, see their opinions, check if others understood it the same way I did, and learn what they liked or didn’t like. So I usually check reviews on IMDb or Letterboxd, or I discuss it with friends if they’ve seen the movie too.\n\nI think Letterboxd is great, but it doesn’t go far enough (in terms of UX and also the social networking aspect). So, I’m thinking about developing an app that would serve as a social network for discussing creative works (movies, series, books, video games, etc.). The app would be segmented so you wouldn’t be distracted by book-related content when you’re looking at movies, for instance.\n\nIt would include all the basic features—seeing movie details, finding out where they’re available to stream, rating them, adding them to a watchlist, etc.—but the main focus would really be on the social aspect. Essentially, the homepage would display posts from your friends or people you follow, as well as popular posts. You could interact with posts, somewhat like on Twitter. Each post would need to be linked to a specific “media object” (a director, a movie, an actor, etc.).\n\nThere would also be groups, either private groups with friends, featuring tools to help pick a movie to watch together (taking into account everyone’s preferences based on their ratings and applying additional filters), or public groups like Facebook groups focused on specific topics: Christmas movies, Nolan, Dupieux, etc.\n\nI see this social network as a mix between Letterboxd, Reddit, and Twitter, so I’m wondering if it might be redundant and if I’m just overthinking it, haha.\n\nAnyway, what do you think? Would anyone here be interested in such an app? Do you have any feedback?\n\nThanks!\n\nLet me know if you’d like further refinements!",

I have a simple question (spoiler alert!). Wasn't poisoning coffee pot  too risky and turned out to be gangsters' fatal mistake. Instead of waiting for John Ruth to fall asleep, or I dunno, go to to  the outhouse. This poisoned coffee led to the failure of the whole scheme that the gang had conceived. Were they presumably spooked by extra company of Warren and Mannix and the coach driver. But given unpredictability of poison action the more people were involved the more likely it was to fail (all 4 people should take coffee at about the same time, and then poison acts at different speed for different people, plus depends on how fast they drink their coffee etc). OTOH, one may argue, the gansters should have started shooting using their planted pistols as soon as commotion caused by poisoning ensued.  What I am saying that this bit seemed a little contrived.

The movie would have been better if it were presented as a drama without musical. It labeled itself as a comedy but I didn't see any funny parts besides that cringe-worthy hospital song. Overall, the songs were hardly songs. Most of the music were whispered conversations. I did like Mi Camino and El Amor.\n\nI did enjoy the movie though. I've seen it twice this weekend.

        "selftext": "Ah yes, The Little Mermaid. The movie that began the Disney Renaissance, the film that sparked my love for redheads, and quite possibly one of Disney's best films. Hard to believe it's now 35 years old. By god, how time flies by, and I meant it when I said this is one of Disney's best films.\n\nThe animation still holds up extremely well, the beautiful colors and scope truly captured the world under the seas beautifully, as well as the world of the surface. The songs are well written, catchy, and extremely memorable, and progress the story as every great musical should. All the characters are (for the most part) likable and memorable. Such as Eric, Sebastian (AKA, the Jamaican crab), Scuttles, Flounder, Ursula (AKA, one of the best Disney villains with one of the best Disney Villain songs, ever), and of course, Ariel, who i think is one of the best Disney Princesses/protagonists of all time. Her motivations of wanting to see more then just the sea can be relatable to anyone who's wanted more out of life then what they have now, and she is still very caring and selfless (yeah, I said it) towards her friends.\n\nI also love how much expression she has even when she's is mute, and her romance with Eric is one of the best Romances Disney has given us. But back to Ursula, Ursula is one of the many goats of Disney villains. Like seriously, she's is an absolute ball, and her villain song is one of the best, and they still make when genuinely terrifying, especially towards the end when she goes full kaiju.\n\nEither way, this movie is a classic, and I will absolutely love it from beginning to end. Happy 35th, and God bless Ariel and Jodi Benson.",

I found it through seeing gifs of it out of context and wanting to know what they were from, and as challenging as it is, it's certainly one of a kind. I've thought about it a lot since seeing it and the best way I can describe it is it feels like if you had a grainy, low-resolution broadcast of what hell looks like on an alien planet. If that sounds like your thing, it probably is.\n\nThat being said, in the grand scheme of things it's pretty obscure but not TOTALLY unknown. Obviously there's all sorts of Tubi shit and direct-to-streaming stuff with zero reviews, but I'm more so looking for actual unique curiosities and movies that REALLY went under the radar.\n\nAs far as stuff I've seen in theaters, it would probably be last years *Moon Garden*, a really wonderful surreal odyssey that literally only made about $48,000. I loved it but I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere since.",

But I didn't realise it's a word play on the olde English meaning.\n\nI was watching an episode of 'Wolf Hall' on the BBC. A drama about 16th century English king Henry the 8th.  \nIn the drama, Thomas Cromwell laments that he has wronged people who are no longer alive. He talks about how you can change the mind of someone who is alive but not someone who is dead. But he uses odd middle English phrasing.  \n  \nHe says, \"*You can persuade the quick, but how do you remake your reputation with the dead*?\"  \n  \nInstead of 'alive' he uses the phrase 'quick'. Which made me think of The Gene Hackman, Russel Crow, Sharon Stone, Leonardo Decaprio movie 'The Quick and the Dead'. A title which obviously refers to those who are a quick draw surviving and those who are not quick being killed.  \n  \nUpon researching how a phrase 'quick and dead' made it into medieval dialogue, I found that the movie title is actually inspired by the Apostles' Creed used in some Catholic and Protestant church services \"*He shall come to judge the quick and the dead*\"  \n  \nIn this case, ‘quick’ is derived from the Olde English ‘cwic’ to mean, ‘alive’ or ‘moving’ or ‘animated’.  \n  \nSo the movie title of ‘The Quick and the Dead’ literally just means ‘The living and the dead’. But of course, it’s also a clever wordplay about quick draw gunfighters.",

        "selftext": "I've only ever watched maybe 3 of these films prior to watching them now. I've gone back and forth with a few of the rankings and am curious to hear others opinions about movies that they liked/disliked that I may have ranked differently. A few that I was debating about moving them further down were Home on the Range and Wish.\n\n1. Tangled: The characters, the storyline, the villain. Everything about this movie was a masterpiece. I feel like I need to do a rewatch to get the full effect in again. Flynn and Rapunzel were great protagonists and Mother Gothel was a very well written villain. Those scenes where she is talking lovingly to Rapunzel, but it is actually to the hair are brilliant. 10/10!!\n2. Emperors New Groove: Right from the get-go, this movie hooked me in with its hilarious antics. Funniest movie hands down. \n3. Zootopia: Really interesting concept with the animals, the plot twist with the villain was executed really well. It was something that should be obvious but wasn’t. I’m excited to watch the sequel next year!\n4. Mulan: Initially did not want to watch this as it seemed boring but it was easily the best in the era. So many ranges of emotion and the journey of Mulan felt well paced and not rushed at all.\n5. Fox and the Hound: Another one I did not want to watch as I thought it was just a stereotypical Disney movie about animals (lady and the tramp cough cough), but MAN this movie really tugged on my heartstrings. When the old lady left Todd in the forest, I felt so bad for him and was hoping for a reunion in the end.\n6. Tarzan: Used to enjoy this a lot as a child and was not disappointed. The living in the jungle concept was executed much better than Jungle Book in my opinion.\n7. Wreck it Ralph: The entire movie was so different and interesting! I had a hunch that King Candy was the villain but when it was revealed he was Turbo, I was shook! Too bad the sequel did not hit the same.\n8. Cinderella: Pretty good for its time. Easily was my favourite from the older movies.\n9. Treasure Planet: Like many of the movies in this era, I actually enjoyed them. The relationship with Jimmy and Silver was so back and forth, I actually could not tell if he would redeem himself in the end. I enjoyed the grey area that their relationship fell into and it was not so black and white.\n10. Beauty and the Beast: Classic movie. Great characters. Enough said.\n11. Atlantis: Thought I would hate this, but it reminded me a bit of Treasure Planet. The journey was interesting and it was another where I wasn’t 100% sure if the characters would come through for Milo, but most of them redeemed themselves.\n12. Hercules: Hades really made this movie as a great villain. The characters were good, the concept was different and its another great classic. I didn’t really enjoy the character of Meg though.\n13. Great Mouse Detective: Ratigan was a great villain. So evil. I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would.\n14. Raya and the Last Dragon: This was a movie that I did not watch until the very end of going through all the animated movies because the trailer looked very meh but it was one that engaged me right from the beginning. The concept of the people coming together from different parts of the land was very layered and I liked that. I wish Fang was given a bit more shit though but what can you do. Initially I found the quirkiness of the dragon to be kind of annoying, but she was a great contrast to Raya’s serious nature.\n15. Peter Pan: Good for its time. Everyone’s infatuation with Peter Pan was kind of annoying but that was sort of the backbone of the movie and Neverland, so I think that was the purpose which I thought was done well. Captain Hook was also a good villain. Tinkerbell was annoying af. \n16. Princess and the Frog: This movie felt really real, it was a real struggle that people could relate too. The character of Prince Naveen didn’t really click with me and I felt like the villain was weak. But other than that, the movie was interesting and I enjoyed it.\n17. Bolt: I thought I would hate this but MAN the idea that Bolt thought he had superpowers but it was just for a TV show was BRILLIANT. I think what would have made this movie a lot better though was if it wasn’t revealed to the audience right away. If we found out towards the end that Bolt didn’t have any powers because it was for a TV show would have been the ultimate plot twist.\n18. Encanto: I really liked the music and the entire storyline of Encanto. The characters were interesting and it was very mysterious. I wanted Mirabel to have some kind of gift at the end, but I guess her gift was her normalcy. The only complaint I have with Encanto and why it isnt ranked higher is the Abuella literally treated Mirabel like shit and got off so easy. Like I wish that it had taken her a lot longer to rectify her mistake. Maybe she could have dug herself deeper?\n19. Wish: Read a bit online about how people thought it was a flop and pushed this one off till the end too. I enjoyed it though. It was obvious that King Magnifico would be a villain and I low-key was hoping he would pull through in the end. I felt like that part was a bit predictable and one-dimensional but other than that, the idea was unique and the storyline was interesting. Took me way too long to realize that the friends (can’t even remember their names) were supposed to be based off the seven dwarfs. The characters were pretty lame tbh.\n20. Big Hero 6: It was so obvious who the villain was and I didn’t get why Professor Callaghan couldn’t just execute his plan for revenge another way? I liked it but I felt like there was a layer missing to the villain. Not sure if I missed something in this movie. It felt like a simple movie, but I did still enjoy it and the idea of Baymax was cool.\n21. Lion King: One of the few Disney movies I had properly watched before watching all of these now. It’s always going to be a classic one but I think I have just seen it so many times that it just feels meh to me now. Still on the high-middle of the list though.\n22. Pinocchio: Really well done for the 40s. Some parts of it really creeped me out like that island where boys turned into donkeys. Super disturbing! There were lots of random storylines in this movie though that I felt weren’t resolved properly.\n23. Hunchback of Notre Dame: So dark. Like really dark. This movie was really set apart from other Disney movies I feel like because of this. Frollo was the most evil villain from all the movies. I feel like I need to do a rewatch of it though to properly analyze it again. \n24. Frozen: This movie had some bangers music wise. It was a good movie and I don’t have anything more to say about it really. An above average Disney movie.\n25. Rescuers: I really liked this movie despite it being about mice! The villain was just an evil lady and the environment of it gave me the creeps as well. The way it was drawn gave such dark vibes.\n26. Aladdin: Honestly overrated. It was good but not epic as other people think. The characters were good but there was just something missing that I can’t quite put my finger on. \n27. Little Mermaid: Another one that I didn’t understand the hype about. Undersea concept was cool but it was just Ariel being lovesick the whole movie. Felt like a drag to watch it to be honest. If it didn’t take place underwater, I probably would have ranked it much lower.\n28. Ralph Breaks the Internet: The concept had so much potential and I was so excited to watch this after the original but man what a letdown. I felt like the story was all over the place and did we really need that much time of Vanelope racing around in some GTA style game? They had so much potential with what they could have done on the internet, I feel like it was wasted. \n29. Robinhood: Bland but it was interesting at times. It had like a nostalgic tone to it. Hence why I ranked it here.\n30. Chicken Little: Okay. So I went into this movie expecting to HATE it with all the reviews I saw online. In the first half, I was quite impressed! I could not understand how people did not like this movie. It was about a son that just wanted to impress his father.. but then all that crap about the aliens was thrown in? It honestly lost me in the middle to end bit. The end was alright though with the dad helping out his son. \n31. Meet the Robinsons: Kind of hard to wrap my head around at first and like Chicken Little, it lost me in the middle bit there. But while I could see that Lewis was obviously the dad of Wilbur in the future, I did not see that twist coming with Goob! It absolutely blew my mind away and why I ranked it higher than I probably would have otherwise.\n32. Sleeping Beauty: Typical old school Disney movie, kind of boring. Ranked it here because its a classic.\n33. Winnie the Pooh: I watched the first one first and was dreading this. But it was pretty good tbh. The Bacson part was hilarious. \n34. 101 Dalmatians: I always heard about Cruela being this huge villain and don’t get me wrong, skinning puppies for your clothing is pretty sick but I was waiting for her to do something the whole movie. It felt really slow paced and predictable. Nothing really jumped out to me.\n35. Brother Bear: The beginning part got me hooked. The death of the older brother and the way that Kenai was turned into a bear was so creative… then they had to bring that little bear into it and it got dreadful. Like I was so over the scenes with Koda in them and then he chose to be a bear in the end? What kind of dumb ending was that. I think it would have been better if both of the remaining brothers were turned into bears and learned to live amongst other bears and then turned back. Another movie that had some wasted potential tbh.\n36. Oliver and Company: Entertaining movie with an interesting twist on Oliver Twist (lol). Pretty average, nothing really stands out.\n37. Rescuers Down Under: Compared to the original it was lame. I can’t even recall anything significant from this movie. Boy was kidnapped but it didn’t have the same effect as the original.\n38. Pocahontas: I did not like this movie. It wasn’t even the colonization aspect of it alone, it just felt very bland compared to others in its era.\n39. Lilo and Stitch: I got into this movie towards the second half. Lilo and Stitch both got on my nerves throughout the movie and I really did not like any of the characters much. It wasn’t horrible, but was pretty mediocre and cringe at times. \n40. Frozen 2: What the hell was even happening in this movie? I had to read on reddit after I watched it to even understand what was happening. If they were going to build up the parents that much, they should have had them shipwrecked on that island ALIVE as well.\n41. Black Cauldron: Hard to wrap my head around this one too. Characters were lame, I can’t even remember any of their names lol. Apparently it’s one of the darkest Disney films and I kind of got that vibe from the art style. Nothing too memorable, some parts were interesting. I enjoyed the witches.\n42. Moana: So boring. Did not understand the hype at all. Another one where I felt like they had an okay concept but the way it was executed wasn’t great. Probably just got excited that they had Dwayne Johnson as a voice actor and based the storyline around his character.\n43. Aristocats: Had a similar nostalgia feel to it that Robin Hood did but the movie itself could have been better. First off, who leaves their entire fortune to their cats? Secondly, why couldn’t the butler just wait a few years for the cats to die (its not like his master was dead - so wouldn’t it make more sense for him to get rid of her first?) I felt like the plot was not thought out and they just threw something together with cats. Story was alright, the characters were whatever. Very below average for me.\n44. Dumbo: Pretty basic storyline. Was good for its time I guess but just a bit of a boring watch.\n45. Dinosaur: The storyline was okay. The journey to the grass land or whatever it was an okay enough plot but my problem is with the horrendous CGI. I feel like if this was a regular animated movie then I would have ranked it higher. I couldn’t even tell the difference between some of the dinosaurs because they all looked the same.\n46. Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad: I did not mind the Ichabod part, it was actually quite interesting and the ending really creeped me out. Mr. Toad’s part was a challenge to get through, it just felt like it was dragging on.\n47. Fantasia: I get that there was nothing else like this in its time but holy hell it was brutal to watch. Two hours of it too. Please enlighten me on why people enjoy this.\n48. The Jungle Book: I really wanted to enjoy this given how much I enjoyed Tarzan but nope. I liked the Bare Necessities song, but I felt like it was just Mowgli bouncing around from groups of animals with Shere Khan being hyped up the whole movie and making an appearance for what felt like a whole 5 seconds. And then the way it ended? After all that, Mowgli just leaves after some girl. I also had a good laugh at some of the names (Shere Khan and Hathi), being a Indian person LOL.\n49. Lady and the Tramp: Stereotypical Disney Movie. Just an overall bore. Lame characters, lame storyline. I feel like its just hyped up for that Spaghetti kiss scene.\n50. Snow White: Okay so what happened? Literally felt like the entirety of the movie was singing about hand washing and then Snow White is poisoned and jets off with a guy who kissed her while she was sleeping. I know this was the first Disney movie so people have love for it, but if we look beyond that, I see nothing that makes it worthwhile. Literally only put it here because it’s the first movie and there are surprisingly worse ones than this.\n51. Three Caballeros: Just awful. The antics of Donald Duck were what somewhat redeemed this abomination.\n52. Melody Time: Boring. The only one that captured my attention was the cowboy skit towards the end and the reason its ranked higher than some of the movies below.\n53. Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Boring. Boring. Boring. I did not need to watch Winnie the Pooh talk about honey for this long. The sequel was muuuch better.\n54. Home on the Range: I thought I would give this one a chance because I always like things that most other people don’t but yeah it was horrendous. The storyline was so difficult to follow. How many things needed to happen in this movie? The characters were insufferable and yeah there was absolutely nothing good about this movie. The only reason it isn’t ranked lower is because those ones were even worse than this.\n55. Bambi: Another one that I really wanted to like but no. I knew that Bambi’s mom died so I waited for that scene but it was over before it even happened. I thought it being a movie from the 1940’s, it would at least show Bambi mourning over the mother’s body but no. It was really just a movie about watching Bambi dance around discovering the forest.\n56. Fantasia: 2000: Same explanation as above. \n57. Alice in Wonderland: This was my first pick and what launched me on this Disney movie watching marathon but it was a huge disappointment. Just random things happening with no proper storyline. I guess it makes sense since it was supposed to just be a dream but I found it just so much wasted potential. Wonderland itself was such a cool concept that they could have really done something better with it.\n58. Strange World: Unmemorable characters, dumb storyline. What was this movie? I found it so hard to follow along what was happening and I had to pause many times and go back to understand what was happening. The characters were so boring and lacked personality. This was a flop for sure.\n59. Fun and Fancy Free: Unmemorable, Boring.\n60. Saludos Amigos: Same as above but with more racism.\n61. Sword in the Stone: To be the absolute worst movie is just next level. The fact that it’s not one of those horrendous war time era ones is even worse but Sword in the Stone was such garbage from the minute it started. The characters were SO lame and the way they were drawn felt lazy to me, there was just something about this whole movie that was so unappealing. Not just the storyline even, the characters, the animation, all of it. ",

        "selftext": "Something I wish was brought up more in discussion is Mary (Ellie’s mom and Charlie’s ex-wife). She’s just abusive towards Ellie as Charlie was when he chose to be a dead beat for years. The way she spoke to Ellie was just as cruel as how Ellie spoke to Charlie. And the fact she calls her own daughter evil is insanely alarming and horrifying. Even if she didn’t say that to Ellie’s face, the fact she said that at all truly shows how terrible of a parent she is. She’s also clearly an alcoholic by her behavior and through Ellie’s dialogue and I wouldn’t be surprised if the reason why we see Ellie smoking is because of Mary since we saw her do the same thing just to rub salt on the wound. \n\nSo because of the very implied neglect and verbal abuse Ellie receives from her mother and her father being absent it’s no wonder why Ellie got so messed up she isn’t in a home where she felt loved and/or wanted so she took it out on the people at her school and Thomas. Slashing her teachers tires, bullying her classmates, and being generally hateful, manipulate, and antagonistic which is all horrible and Ellie just getting suspended instead of expulsion is pretty unrealistic to me but no matter how true this is to real life I have seen kids in fiction act in a similar manner to Ellie because of parent neglect and in Ellie’s case I don’t think it’s just because she’s angry I think she just was to get noticed by people. Heck she even makes fun of her parents online. And why does anyone post anything online? To get noticed. For people to agree with the person who made a post, for likes and feelings of validation or just to get some emotional reaction. And I’m sorry but \nafter rewatching scenes of the movie I don’t think even Charlie did as great of a job with paying attention to Ellie as I first thought.\n\nBefore I go on I want to make it clear that I feel horrible for Charlie and he IS a sympathetic character even the mom but I want to express how Charlie’s behavior towards Ellie and totally disregarding him abandoning her at 8 years old.\n\nI believe one of the main themes of the movie is facing reality and Charlie definitely wasn’t doing that with Ellie. And not because he wasn’t scolding Ellie for her awful behavior now I'm talking about his ex wife and her treatment towards Ellie. I remember a scene where Ellie says her Mom is only happy when she drinks and Charlie just changed the subject. He’s not really listening to his daughter either because he’s giving Mary the benefit or he just doesn’t want to talk about anything negative to Ellie which both make sense for his character but it doesn’t feel very genuine to Ellie. There are maybe one or two scenes like that but it was the one that caught my attention the most.\n\nI had a lot of feelings about this movie and I might make another post but I wanted the family to be the first thing I wanted to post about this movie.\n\n",

        "title": "I watched and rated every 1990s Pauly Shore movie this weekend",
        "selftext": "As we all know, Pauly Shore was the pinnacle of comedy in the 1990s, and Hollywood has been chasing that high ever since. With recent real world events wreaking havoc on my mental health, I decided to spend this weekend zoning out with The Weasel and bringing myself back to the simpler days of my childhood. It's been a long time since I've watched a Pauly Shore movie, and I knew before I started that this could possibly turn into a harrowing experience, but I was determined to stick it through.\n\nFull spoilers ahead.\n\n___\n\n**Encino Man – 1992**\n\nPauly Shore’s leading man career started with *Encino Man*. As you’re probably aware (unless you're too young to remember), this movie also served as Brendan Fraser’s breakout role, and he would then go on to carve his own path through the ‘90s. Co-starring Sean Astin, *Encino Man* tells the story of best friends Dave (Astin) and Stoney (Shore). After an earthquake uncovers a frozen caveman (Fraser) in Dave’s backyard, the two friends thaw him out and discover that he’s still alive. They name him Link, get Dave’s parents to believe he’s a foreign exchange student from Estonia, and enroll him in high school as a senior. Link is immediately popular, shenanigans ensue, and at the end of the movie, he gives bad boy villain Matt (Michael DeLuise) his comeuppance at prom by spinning him in circles and throwing him into a cake. He’s then crowned prom king, and the movie ends with a party at Dave’s house where Stoney and Link discover that another earthquake has uncovered a living cavewoman—Link’s partner from the ice age.\n\n*Encino Man* is a strong introduction to everything Pauly Shore sort of represented at the time: being yourself, shunning cultural expectations, and just having a good time. The biggest surprise upon re-watching this film was realizing that Matt isn’t the real villain in the story (although he is an asshole). The real villain is Sean Astin’s character Dave. From the very beginning, he makes it clear that he only wants to use Link so he can get popular and finally grab the attention of his crush, Robyn. And he sticks with this until the final act when he realizes that Link is more trouble than he’s worth—so he literally ditches him on the side of the road like a dog, leading to [the most dramatic scene in the film]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npOGUD3g454). Stoney, meanwhile, is the voice of reason. He teaches Link important things like weezing the juice, eating grindage, and flirting with nugs. But most importantly, he teaches him about friendship.\n\nWhile Encino Man isn’t my favorite Pauly Shore movie, I definitely consider it necessary viewing if you want to understand what it means to be The Weasel. And a fun fact for those doing their own Pauly Shore marathon: Brendan Fraser’s Link makes a cameo appearance in several other Pauly flicks!\n\nRegular movie rating: 6/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 7.5/10\n\n___\n\n**Son in Law – 1993** \n\nThe Weasel goes to the country in this fish out of water tale. Becca (Carla Gugino) is a South Dakotan farmgirl. After graduating from high school, she goes to college in the lawless land of California. Her first two months are rough, and right when she’s about to give up, her RA Crawl (Pauly Shore) intervenes and convinces her to stick around and let loose. One transformation montage later, Becca is now weezing and munching grindage with the best of them. Now it’s Thanksgiving break, and it’s time to see her family for the first time since becoming Becca 2.0. When she learns that Crawl will be alone over break, she brings him home to South Dakota. At dinner on their first night back, Becca’s high school boyfriend Travis (Dan Gauthier) proposes. Becca doesn’t want to marry him, so Crawl intervenes by saying that he and Becca are already engaged! Everyone is shocked, and the rest of the film is Crawl learning to be a bit more country while teaching everyone else to live a bit more like the Weasel. The movie ends with the family finding out that Travis roofied Crawl and Becca’s best friend Tracy (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) to make it look like they slept together. Becca and Crawl kick him to the curb, and the two announce that they’re putting the wedding on hold for now.\n\nI legitimately enjoy this movie, and it’s my second favorite Pauly Shore film. Yes, it’s dumb and critically panned like all his movies, but Pauly shines through much better in this than in Encino Man since he contrasts so well with the good ol’ country folk of South Dakota. He even gets through to Becca’s parents and grandparents about not judging people by first appearances. This movie also has a great supporting cast including Lane Smith (fresh off *The Mighty Ducks*), Cindy Pickett (aka Mrs. Bueller), and Patrick Renna (who won our hearts as Ham in *The Sandlot* that same year).\n\nRegular movie rating: 7/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 9/10\n\n___\n\n**In the Army Now – 1994** \n\nDespite the ‘90s homophobia and Arabphobia, I think this movie is Pauly Shore’s strongest, as he mostly abandons his Weasel persona for a straight up goofball comedy. Bones (Pauly Shore) and his best friend Jack (Andy “I’m a piece of shit” Dick) want to open their own stereo store but don’t have enough money—so they join the army reserves. Under the impression that after basic training they’ll never see combat, they of course get called up due to a conflict in Chad. Specializing in water purification along with their squad mates Christine (Lori Petty) and Fred (David Alan Grier), they discover that they’re actually really good at their jobs. But after a mission they’re assigned to goes wrong, they become stranded in the desert until they’re eventually captured by Libyans, who are preparing to fire chemical weapons at U.S. bases. With the help of another captured American soldier, Sgt. Stern (Esai Morales), they escape the prison during an attack, rendezvous with a special ops supply drop, and pinpoint the weapons with a laser targeting system so the Americans can blow up the Libyan base and save the day. The movie ends with Bones and Jack opening their new store.\n\nI’ve seen this movie way more times in my life than any reasonable person should, and it’s definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures. Having Pauly Shore just be a regular idiot rather than his Weasel character makes all the silliness much more palatable, as his usual schtick would be way too annoying and unbelievable in a military situation. Once again, a strong supporting cast makes this film better than it should be (even Andy Dick is bearable). Lori Petty doesn’t disappoint as the badass female soldier and Bones’ love interest, and one of my favorite character actors, Art LaFleur, appears as the squadron’s commanding officer. However, since this is Pauly Shore at his highest, things can only go down from here…\n\nRegular movie rating: 7.5/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 10/10\n\n___\n\n**Jury Duty – 1995** \n\nAnd the decline is incredibly steep. Even on the Pauly Shore bell curve, this movie is awful, just absolute shit all around. Tommy Collins (Pauly Shore) has no job, no money, and nowhere to live when his mother and her boyfriend decide to drive their trailer to Vegas to get married. Luckily for Tommy, he’s just been chosen for jury duty. He manipulates the system to get put onto a case that will take a long time to prosecute so he can keep taking advantage of the free lodging and food (he gets himself into a fancy hotel suite while the rest of the jurors are staying in crappy rooms). Once jury deliberations begin, he continually stalls by claiming the defendant is innocent, pulling off his worst Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men impression (a scene of which literally features in this movie to hammer home to the audience what’s happening). All good things come to an end, though, when another juror, Monica (Tia Carrere) discovers Tommy’s plan. The judge declares a mistrial and the jury is dismissed. But Tommy believes in himself, discovers that the real killer was actually on the jury the whole time, and the killer is caught at the end thanks to plot conveniences.\n\nI laughed *once* during this movie, and it was near the beginning after a dumb but clever joke about tuna fish. While this was obviously written for Pauly Shore, I can’t actually put all the blame on him because the writing is dreadful and does him no favors. The three credited screenwriters are clearly trying to go for a Zucker brothers vibe with the humor a la *The Naked Gun* and *Top Secret!*, but they fail at almost every opportunity. That, along with way too many dated transphobia jokes, make this an absolute slog to watch. The real crime, though, is that this movie wastes an absolutely STACKED cast. Just look at this [IMDB page]( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113500/)! Along with Stanley Tucci and Shelley Winters (in a very small role as Tommy’s mom), this trash is filled with some amazing character actors. It’s such a shame that so much talent was wasted here.\n\nRegular movie rating: 2/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 2/10\n\n___\n\n**Bio-Dome – 1996** \n\nNot as bad as Jury Duty, but still terrible, *Bio-Dome* is the story of stoner best friends Bud (Pauly Shore) and Doyle (Stephen “Definitely the worst brother” Baldwin), who accidentally get trapped in a Bio-Dome—a yearlong environmental science experiment to see if humans can survive in a carefully crafted microcosm world. After completely destroying the experiment to the chagrin of the scientists inside, they realize that they owe it to everyone to try and save the dome. Several plot conveniences later, they do, and the movie mercifully ends.\n\nThe first two thirds of this movie made me want to claw my eyes out, but the final third does have a handful of jokes that made me chuckle (though I literally can’t remember them even though I’m writing this 10 minutes after finishing the movie). My biggest issue with this film compared to other, much better stoner flicks, is that Bud and Doyle seemingly go out of their way to be complete inconsiderate assholes. They have less common sense than a six-year-old and are so selfish for most of the movie, it defies logic. Most of the “jokes” throughout the film are for their own amusement, as they constantly laugh at their own antics. There are also a couple of horribly dated “sexual assault for laughs” jokes, such as when Bud and Doyle sneak into bed with two of the female scientists (one of whom is played by Kylie Minogue). The high point of this movie is a very brief appearance from a young Tenacious D.\n\nRegular movie rating: 3/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: 3/10\n\n___\n\n**The Curse of Inferno – 1997** \n\nEven though I grew up in the ‘90s and saw what I thought was every Pauly Shore movie that decade, I somehow never even heard of this. I only found out about it when looking at his IMDB page to see what order to watch these films in. It doesn't even have a [Rotten Tomatoes score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_curse_of_inferno), and that site lists this as 1996, while IMDB lists it as 1997. Was this actually released in theaters?\n\nRegardless, this one was a surprise, as it’s not a “Pauly Shore movie,” but rather a movie with Pauly Shore in it. *The Curse of Inferno* is sort of a Coen Brothers-esque caper about two friends, Chuck (Pauly Shore) and Harold (Max Perlich), who rob a bank at the same time as two other robbers. They hide the money in the bank before escaping, but when Chuck has a change of heart and decides to return the money, he finds out it’s gone. The rest of the story is a bit of a mess. The money is actually being laundered by a greedy local businessman, Moles Huddenel (Ned Beatty), who wants to get it back. At the same time, the local sheriff (Blue Deckert) is also trying to get the money. And the police officer, Layla (Janine Turner), who Chuck falls in love with, is actually an FBI agent who’s using Chuck to take down Moles. Everything works out in the end, and the FBI take down both the sheriff and Moles.\n\nI was not expecting a “serious” Pauly Shore film. It’s not a great movie, but it’s definitely not terrible. Pauly does an admirable job reeling in his usual zaniness for a more restrained, dimwitted country boy character. The biggest problem is that the plot is just very convoluted. With a better script, this could’ve been a “diamond in the rough” film of his career. He certainly doesn’t have the acting chops of other comedians in serious roles like Robin Williams or Jim Carey, but I can’t help feeling that this film did him a disservice and might have dissuaded him from attempting other more serious roles in the future. I'd love to live in the alternate reality where Pauly Shore abandoned his past stereotypes and tried to be a real actor. Even though it’s not a great movie, I do recommend checking this one out simply for the novelty of seeing Pauly Shore in a drama.\n\nRegular movie rating: 5/10\n\nPauly Shore movie rating: Not applicable\n\n___\n\nSo, what did I learn from this marathon? Probably that Pauly Shore is exactly who I remembered him to be, but in another timeline, perhaps he could have been something more? His comedy is absolutely a relic of the '90s, and even though two of these movies were hot garbage, I am glad I decided to watch them all. He's still kicking around today and collecting paychecks, but the heyday of The Weasel is certainly over.",

        "selftext": "We all have those movies that we know aren’t technically great, but we can’t help but enjoy them anyway. For me, *Madame Web* is one of those—it’s not a masterpiece, but its goofy, offbeat vibe makes it strangely fun to watch. Similarly, *Halloween Ends* might have been a poor conclusion to the trilogy, but I still found myself having a good time with it, despite its flaws. Sometimes, the movies we’re \"supposed\" to dislike are the ones we love the most. What are your guilty pleasure movies—the ones that may not be perfect but still bring you joy?",

I wanted to share my Letterboxd top 10 and hear your thoughts on it. These are the movies that have left a lasting impression on me—some because they’re visually stunning, others because of their storytelling, and a few just because they hit me emotionally at the right time.\n\nI know movie taste is super subjective, and everyone sees films differently, so I’m curious: what do you think of my picks? Are they solid choices, or do you think some are overrated? Is there a masterpiece I’ve totally missed that should absolutely be on here? I’m really interested in hearing your opinions—whether you agree, totally disagree, or have suggestions for films I should check out. Let me know if you have a top 10 of your own; I’d love to see it! That said, my list is definitely not set in stone. I’m always watching new films, so my top 10 is bound to change as I discover more movies that blow me away. If you have any recommendations, I’m all ears",

        "selftext": "First of all, yes, **the** ***Minority Report*** **is a really interesting and entertaining movie**. I get you're not meant to take it all literally and you should suspend disbelief for a sci-fi film. The movie has a powerful and relevant message that it is very dangerous for any society to trust its police too much.\n\nBut also I think part of the fun of social sci-fi is poking holes into what works logically or not assuming the fictional technology works as presented by the movie. In this case the *Minority Report* is not as dystopian comapred to real-world policing as it thinks it is.\n\n**The part about experimenting on the already traumatised precognitive children checks out.** I can believe a government being willing to experiment on and imprison three innocent mentally ill kids to end murder across all of D.C. and covering it up. These are the children of junkies, and its not like the government had an effective way of understanding let along treating them. The bad guy did a bad guy murder because he needed to cover up his treatment of Agatha, and that's plausible to me. 10/10 for that bit of dystopia. Very interesting *The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas* stuff.\n\nIf anything I think its likely that the government would be secretly finding more pregnant drug addicts and making more convenient precogs after the movie ended. Big points to John for stopping that.\n\nOn the other hand, **I don't think there would need to be a big conspiracy to cover up that the precogs are not infallible**. When John is looking into the minority reports, he finds only six of them were covered up, over an entire state for six years. Eyewitnesses, fingerprints and DNA evidence get it wrong a lot more often that that, and the USA is still willing to imprison people based on that kind of evidence. Not only that, but it consistently directs cops to people who are comitting murders. Even if the report is circumstantial, it directs police to attempted murders with impressive regularity, and when they fet there there will probably be a lot of other evidence of attempted murder.\n\nIRL even the best justice systems get it wrong sometimes. We kind of accept that because you have to stop all the real criminals. The pre-crime division is more effective, with probably a lower wrongful conviction rate than any real-life police force. I think false positives would still be acceptable to most people.\n\nThe closing narration reveals that **every person convicted of future murder was released (but some are under surveilance)**. But wouldn't a lot of those people have been obviously stopped halfway through committing a murder? Most of them should still be in prison and all the ones who are out should be under surveilance.\n\nThe glasses guy from the start of the movie was caught actively trying to stab his wife with a pair of scissors. Is he just free now? Imagine if a guy spent five minutes attacking you, and then got tackled by police right before he finished the job, but now he's a free man because he committed future murder instead of attempted murder. That's messed up.",

That being said, I think that streaming is absolutely great since you have to ability to access older movies and shows whenever you want. I don’t however, think they are helping new movies at all. Tv show have always been “free to watch.” You don’t have to pay extra to money to go and watch them. That should obviously remain the same. What I don’t get is why aren’t movies still like that? It’s one thing to not want your movie to go to the box office, and bring it direct to streaming. But I think that you should still have to pay extra to watch those movies. For example, a new movie comes out on Max or Paramount. You already pay for subscription. But that subscription should only cover shows that are new and old, but only movies that are older. The industry is about money, so why not charge extra to make people watch these movies? I’m pretty sure that Black Widow did this where they charged like 10 bucks or so. Don’t know how well it turned out for them, but if every streaming service does this, and change could be made. I think it could also help theaters and the box office because studios will come to decide to just bring everything back to the theaters. \n\nThis could be a completely idiotic idea.

        "selftext": "I actually saw this at an early screening so it was before any of the reviews had come out, and having been all over the board with M Night, I never really know what to expect, but the concept for this one was more interesting to me than either of the last two movies he's made, so I was at least curious to check it out.\n\nAs far as the 'believability' of it, I was a little surprised how many people seemed to just totally be in shock that M Night would make a film with a ridiculous concept, given that he also made a movie about a beach that makes you old, meaning I wasn't exactly holding out for stark realism. I admit, it is an absurd premise, but when the movie is being pitched as 'Silence of the Lambs at a Taylor Swift concert', I'm not going into it expecting anything other than entertaining schlock, which is exactly what I got. It feels like a slightly shitty De Palma movie, but I'll take a flawed, original concept over fucking Venom 3 or Red One any day.\n\nThe main reason this works at all, for me at least, is Josh Hartnett. M Night movies live or die on their characters, and while this is nowhere near Bruce Willis in Unbreakable or James McAvoy in Split, I still thought he really understood exactly what he needed to bring, and the fact that it was contextualized as 'an obsessive serial killer in a highly tense situation having to feign normalcy' made the signature weird Shyamalan dialogue make a lot more sense, especially when the daughter would call him out on sounding weird.\n\nHis performance (and the film in general) has been compared to the Hitman games, and I think that's pretty apt. It's also a movie where the overall quality of the production combined with the ridiculousness helps make it feel like 'polished/\"elevated\" schlock', which studios aren't really making a lot of anymore, for better or for worse.\n\nAfter rewatching it on streaming the other night just to see if anything had changed from the early version I saw (it hadn't), I can definitely admit the hype of being at a screening gave me a bit of a rose-tinted view of it the first time, but in general I still thought it was a fun movie with more self awareness than Shyamalan usually has, and had enough fun with its concept that I was a little bummed when it seemed like most people really weren't digging it, at least at first. Curious how y'all felt about this one.",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than 20 days, I ask you for your most favorite movie set in a given european country once a day. For example, two days ago, it was Italy's turn in this little filmic journey and I have to say: While I'm a bit disappointed, that literally nobody mentioned *A Roman Holiday* or (if you want a genuine italian movie to win) any part of the *Don Camillo* series, I think we have another deserving winner here. It got really exciting again: At one point it looked as if  *Ladri di biciclette* (engl.: *Bicycle Thieves*) would be the first film from the 40s to make the list, and in between there was a real neck-and-neck race with *La Vita E Bella* (engl.: *Life is Beautiful*), but in the end ***Nuovo Cinema Paradiso*** (that was only called *Cinema Paradiso* in the English distribution for whatever reason) has brought it home.\n\nBecause I started the next round a bit earlier yesterday (in order to watch *Gladiator II*, another movie mostly set in Italy), I have another winner to announce. The victory here was very clear - the only controversy in some parts of the world might be that I see the region in question as a country in its own right. Nevertheless, I am happy to give ***Zgjoi*** (engl.: *Hive*) a spot in [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). before we move on to the next country: **Latvia**. For those of you who are still new here, here are the two rules of this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n# \n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italia - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

I finally watched it last night and I was blown away.\n\nI know it often gets unfavourably compared with Tombstone, and I love Tombstone, but to me it's far more absorbing and an all round better film. You get a far better understanding of the Earps, their flawed personalities and what led to the OK Corral shootout and consequent vendetta.\n\nI struggle to understand what the critics issue with it was? Yes it was long, at just over 3 hours, but it never felt bloated. I never felt that any of it was over indulgent. The shootout at the OK Corral was, as far as I'm aware, pretty much true to life. Far more abrupt and less Hollywood than it's usually depicted.\n\nAlso the performances were superb. I never thought anyone could surpass Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, but Dennis Quaid was absolutely sensational and brought a dark, unhinged menace to the role that I really enjoyed. You can tell he's really struggling to hold his fraying will to live together.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind strapping in for a 3 hour biopic.",

Of course his performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius was iconic but his performance as Captain Jack Aubrey was, imo, on another level. I'll admit I haven't read the books so I'm not 100% sure he physically resembles his book counterpart.\n\nOpposite him is a wonderful Paul Bettany as Surgeon Stephen Maturin. Their friendship is the heat of the movie and Crowe and Bettany sold me on what is a living friendship between two rather different men. \n\nMy favorite character is Mr. Blakeney. His entire character arc is fantastic start to finish, post his arm surgery is some great story telling seeing as he leads a boarding party to great effect. \n\nThe best sequence is of course the expedition on the Galapagos island where Stephen intended name a tortoise after Aubrey. I do think using Prelude is cheating seeing as it's a excellent piece of music. \n\nWe also get a few haunting scenes.\n\nWe have a man over board situation where the Captain is forced to cut wreckage loose ultimately dooming the sailor...and that sailor's friend had to assist in the cutting.\n\n Mr. Holm being scapegoated as a Jonah ends up committing suicide in a terrifying way...we see his eyes fade into the inky darkness of the sea as Mr. Blakeney looks on helpessly. \n\nThe best scene is the higher ranking officers at dinner getting hammered and making weevil puns.\n\nIt's a 10/10 movie and a crying shame we didn't get any other movies from Weir.",

I mean at least in the alternate ending, Brock and the rest of the team realized that Rose was actually telling the truth about everything after being skeptical of her and her claims the entire time when she revealed that she actually had the diamond all along and he got to hold it in his hand if only for a brief moment while she tried to tell him that he should value his life more above material possessions and money, but she still threw it overboard anyway. If that were me, f\\*\\*k that old lady, I would have dived head first over that railing and swum down as fast as I could after that thing and I don't even care.  At least there would be a crew of people and boats right there to get me out of the water relatively quickly. Oh and if you have never seen the alternate ending before, here is the clip of it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uXa1R2e4a8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uXa1R2e4a8)\n\nOh and one other thing that the movie never makes clear. Does Rose actually die at the end of the movie? When she is in her bed and dreaming of being back on Titanic and kissing Jack on the Grand Staircase with all the passengers watching them and applauding, is she just dreaming or did she actually pass away in her sleep? I have never been able to tell. I mean I guess it would make sense that she did pass in her sleep because she is 100 years old after all and she did finally let Jack go by throwing away the diamond, so it is probably that, but I could be wrong and I want to know for sure.\n\nRegardless, Titanic is unquestionably one of the greatest films of all time, but both endings have always passed me off.

        "selftext": "Dennis Lehane once admitted that by the time he wrote *Shutter Island*, he felt he was walking a fine line. After exploring themes of child exploitation in *Gone Baby Gone*, *Mystic River*, and *Shutter Island*, he realized he was getting dangerously close to exploiting the issue rather than shining a light on it. It’s a level of self-awareness many creators never achieve. You can only revisit the same dark waters so many times before you’re not pulling people out—you’re pushing them in.\n\nSean Baker feels like he’s headed down that same road. His early work—*Tangerine* and *The Florida Project*—brought raw, authentic empathy to the lives of sex workers and the marginalized. These films weren’t voyeuristic; they were humanizing, giving voice to lives ignored or judged by most of society. But with *Red Rocket* and *Anora*, it’s starting to feel like Baker is running out of gas. The empathy is still there, but the repetition is becoming obvious. How many more gritty, down-on-their-luck sex worker stories can he tell before it’s less about them and more about his brand?\n\nAt a certain point, Baker risks reducing these stories to a theme park ride of \"gritty realism,\" something that feels more like a calling card than a mission. He’s got talent, no question. But he needs to evolve. Lehane recognized the risk and moved on, proving he could still tell compelling stories without mining the same trauma over and over. Baker should take note. Otherwise, he’s in danger of exploiting the very people he set out to champion.",

The movie itself was pretty average although I now understand it’s a cult classic having read up on it after watching.\n\nI gotta say, Nic Cage gives an incredibly wild performance which I’m still trying to determine if this was a classic case of Nic Cage overacting antics or he was in fact just brilliant. \n\nThe only thing I know for sure is he was 100% committed to the role, and I was there with him all the way despite the quality of the movie. It’s like watching someone who is way over the top, but he makes you believe that he believes in himself and what he is doing.\n\nHe’s a remarkable person, strange and fascinating, eccentric and spot on at times in his acting performances. The guy can act when he puts his mind to it, as witnessed in Pig where he was much more subtle. Then you see him in something like Colour Out Of Space, his performance was eccentric to say the least but still watchable all the same like you can’t take your eyes off of him. At times you cringe when he goes off the reservation and other times you’re in awe of his more memorable performances thinking “Is this the same guy??”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on his Vampire’s Kiss role?",

In the early 90s, there were FOUR movies that all centered around two characters going on crime sprees, all in the Western part of the US and all of them either starred Brad Pitt or Juliette Lewis or both and they all came out within a couple years of each other or less:\n\nThelma & Louise - Brad Pitt\n\nTrue Romance - Brad Pitt \n\nNatural Born Killers - Juliette Lewis (yes, I know that this and True Romance were originally one script written by Tarantino)\n\nKalifornia - Brad Pitt AND Juliette Lewis \n\nHow did this come to happen that these 2 actors found themselves in al of these movies and that they all came out between 91-94??  \n",

And with today's technology I doubt it will be hard to recreate the scenes from those comic books. So what stops people from making this? We see mangas being animated as anime, its not 1 to 1 but close enough most of the times, why cant we have something similar in western media but with live action movies instead of animated? Right now 2 of the biggest comic book superhero franchises (marvel and dc) have been very inconsistent with their quality of movies. What stops them from just recreating a movie version of the comics that already did well in the past?",

I've had a go.\n\nThe idea that I saw which was of particular interest to me is that if the Best Picture winner fails to endure, it shouldn't have won. To this end I'm working with five basic values:\n\n* number of ratings on IMDB\n* popularity on Letterboxd\n* average rating Letterboxd\n* average rating IMDB\n* Metascore\n\nbut due to convenience, I was working in ranked forms. So, if the best film has a Metascore of 100 and the second best has a Metascore of 81 in one year whereas for another it's 95 vs 93, then either way they have the same ranks of 1 vs 2.\n\nAfter some simple but numerous calculations, I ultimately produced what I'm calling a SnubFactor.

Similarly, there are some controversial winners in the form of **The Green Book** and, again, Crash. And I don't think anyone who follows Oscar discussions would be too surprised to see **CODA, The Artist** and **The Hurt Locker**, either; I can't remember what people were complaining about with CODA but the latter two were widely criticised as being too underwatched to be credible winners. \n\nIt's the number one seeded films which probably attract more interest. **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2((? **Spider-Man: No Way Home**? I suspect the idea of franchise best picture winners enrages many people in this sub and to the extent other people are willing to consider the concept, these probably wouldn't be the films they'd choose. In the case of NWH, I think maybe we can say that it's too recent for this method to really recover a good sense of which films have a lasting legacy but Deathly Hallows Part 2 is more than a decade old. And you can see from the HypoSnub column that DH 2 is a relatively strong contender. That stands in contrast to Brokeback Mountain which has a *high* HypoSnub value. So, while this analysis agrees that Crash was a bad winner, it's *also* saying 2005 didn't have a clear winner. It was a competitive year where the wrong choice was made. Speaking of clear winners:\n\n# **Films which really should've won... and did!**\n\n| Actual Winner            | OscarYr | AggRank | WinSeed | No1SeedAggRank | SnubFactor | No.1Seed              | HypoSnub | Loss       |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|------------|-----------------------|----------|------------|\n| Return of the King        | 2003    | 1.1     | 1       | 1.1            | 1.02       | Return of the King    | 1.02     | 0.00       |\n| Parasite                  | 2019    | 1.2     | 1       | 1.2            | 1.04       | Parasite              | 1.04     | 0.00       |\n| Schindler's List          | 1993    | 1.3     | 1       | 1.3            | 1.06       | Schindler's List      | 1.06     | 0.00       |\n| The Silence of the Lambs  | 1991    | 1.6     | 1       | 1.6            | 1.13       | The Silence of the Lambs | 1.13   | 0.00       |\n| No Country for Old Men    | 2007    | 2       | 1       | 2              | 1.24       | No Country for Old Men | 1.24   | 0.00       |\n| The Departed              | 2006    | 2.7     | 1       | 2.7            | 1.44       | The Departed          | 1.44     | 0.00       |\n| 12 Years a Slave          | 2013    | 4.2     | 1       | 4.2            | 1.90       | 12 Years a Slave      | 1.90     | 0.00       |\n| EEAAO                    | 2022    | 4.6     | 1       | 4.6            | 2.02       | EEAAO                 | 2.02     | 0.00       |\n| Oppenheimer               | 2023    | 3.6     | 2       | 3.5            | 4.48       | Spider-Verse 2        | 1.68     | -2.80      |\n| Forrest Gump              | 1994    | 3.9     | 3       | 2.4            | 5.23       | Shawshank             | 1.35     | -3.88      |\n\nSo, in the 34 year period, the \"right\" film won 8 times. However, it should be noted that in this analysis **12 Years a Slave** and **The Wolf of Wall Street** are tied in terms of AggRank, so I guess you could say I'm saying Best Picture ought to have been a tie.\n\nThe two films included here which won without being the number one seed have markedly higher SnubFactors than even **EEAAO**, the \"worst\" deserving winner. I feel that this is a sign that my method is capturing something meaningful, even though how I came to it is pretty ad hoc. Note also that both of these films have better AggRanks than either EEAAO or 12 Years a Slave, so I feel like going the extra steps to reflect the dominance of the number one seed (through the SnubFactor) instead of just using the AggRanks made sense. \n\n**Forrest Gump** seems to be undergoing a reappraisal at the moment based on the, frankly, deranged interpretation that a movie about a man who gets rich through an act of God's not sinking a boat which he obtained only through -- very minor -- deceit is \"Conservative propaganda\". (And let's not mention all the political assassinations, Gump's blithe confusion at the concept of the racism he's expected to participate in and, of course, the explicit suggestion that the perfect soldier is someone who unthinkingly follows every order. Whoops. Quick, something something Jenny is punished for using drugs.) I think there was already a groundswell of people who were a bit disappointed that Forrest Gump beat out **The Shawshank Redemption** (the number one seed for 1994) and/or **Pulp Fiction**, but it seems to me that a particular consequence of this reappraisal is that Forrest Gump is now seen as a particularly undeserving Best Picture Winner. \n\nNow, this analysis is conditional on the years it looked at but at least in the last 34 years, Gump is the opposite of a particularly undeserving winner -- in a reasonably competitive year (note Shawshank's relatively low 2.4 AggRank), it might not have been the most deserving winner, but it was relatively close. And if you're wondering what the second seed was if Forrest Gump was 3 and Shawshank 1, I can confirm it was Pulp Fiction (The Lion King was 4).\n\nI could show you a lot more if you're interested, but I'll present only one more table for now (requests welcome) --\n\n# **the ten least convincing number one seeds**\n\n| No.1Seed             | OscarYr | No1SeedAggRank | Actual Winner       | WinSeed | WinAggRank | SnubFactor | HypoSnub | Loss     |\n|-----------------------|---------|----------------|---------------------|---------|------------|------------|----------|----------|\n| No Way Home          | 2021    | 7.4            | CODA                | 16      | 24.5       | 20.42      | 2.92     | -17.50   |\n| Get Out              | 2017    | 6.2            | The Shape of Water  | 13      | 19.4       | 17.23      | 2.53     | -14.70   |\n| Arrival              | 2016    | 5.6            | Moonlight           | 3       | 7.4        | 6.49       | 2.34     | -4.15    |\n| The Father           | 2020    | 5.5            | Nomadland           | 8       | 14         | 12.63      | 2.31     | -10.32   |\n| Brokeback Mountain   | 2005    | 5.3            | Crash               | 37      | 39.6       | 29.77      | 2.24     | -27.52   |\n| EEAAO               | 2022    | 4.6            | EEAAO               | 1       | 4.6        | 2.02       | 2.02     | 0.00     |\n| Fight Club           | 1999    | 4.5            | American Beauty     | 3       | 8          | 7.42       | 1.99     | -5.43    |\n| 12 Years a Slave     | 2013    | 4.2            | 12 Years a Slave    | 1       | 4.2        | 1.90       | 1.90     | 0.00     |\n| Princess Mononoke    | 1997    | 4.1            | Titanic             | 4       | 9          | 9.15       | 1.86     | -7.28    |\n| Dead Poets Society   | 1989    | 4              | Driving Miss Daisy  | 26      | 28.2       | 24.33      | 1.83     | -22.50   |\n\nI have re-ordered the columns to better emphasise what we're interested in here. It is not always the case that a single film establishes itself as a clear front runner. Not every film is Citizen Kane, which I checked and found to have an AggRank of exactly 1! Not even Return of the King managed an AggRank of exactly 1, although as you can see above it gets pretty damn close. And we've also seen that famously strong years for movies like 1994 can generate reasonably low AggRanks for their number one seeds. But some years are, well, like the above.\n\nI think No Way Home is probably the most... controversial number one seed that this method generated. Today, a mere three years from its release, the film seems largely regarded as shallow nostalgia with clumsy pauses for a laugh track that the maker's forgot to ship the movie with. Personally, I think that's a bit harsh -- it's very good nostalgia bait and its ambitions as nostalgia bait are so enormous it's a miracle the film is coherent... by rights it should be a bloated, muddled mess and instead it's just... fine. That's still not a ringing endorsement, of course. I think its AggRank reflects this. It's not a compelling first seed. For example, in terms of the underlying values the AggRank is made of, it's basically indistinguishable from **Dune: Part One** (which has a consequently similar AggRank of 7.5).\n\nThese other movies aren't the same story -- [2021 is an outlier year](https://imgur.com/a/RzJSAkn) -- but they're not that different. None of these movies are distinguishing themselves from the pack. In some cases, I think that's a little surprising. I know Crash is usually more a \"literally anything but Crash\" situation than a \"how was it not Brokeback Mountain\" but maybe the fact twenty years later there's no compelling leader is one of the reasons Crash won.^(1) Similarly, **Driving Miss Daisy** is apparently considered such a bad winner because (the un-nominated) **Do The Right Thing** was right there, but apparently it wasn't. Do The Right Thing is the second seed, though, not too far behind **Dead Poets Society** (which obviously couldn't... seize the award either).\n\nNot all classic snubs are a result of the lack of convincing number one seed -- as we saw **Saving Private Ryan** is a hugely dominant film with a AggRank of 1.5 -- but maybe sometimes they happen because the \"obvious winner\" isn't that obvious? Probably a completely trite thought but I might as well finish this post on it.\n\n^(1)I suspect it's an actor's movie. People didn't vote for it for Best Picture because of the film, they voted for it because of Michael Peña and some of the other performances.",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nfollowing the official list of european countries by the Council of Europe, I've been asking you every day for more than 20 days about your favourite movie set in a given country. Sometimes this leads to confusion and personally, for example, I have now also found a solution to the paradox that the UK is a country made up of several countries (stay tuned!). A little bit of politics just can't seem to be avoided here - and this leads my directly to the next country.\n\nYesterday I asked about Italy and I'm not going to announce a winner here just yet. I'm still a bit early, but I'm going on a trip to the cinema later (‘Gladiator II’ - wish me luck!) and still wanted to continue here in the list today. But the question was: Where to? In fact, the country I'm talking about now is not recognised as such by all other European countries. But I decided at the beginning that if in doubt, I would stick to the Council of Europe: And lo and behold, it is currently even considering accepting it as a member state. And so it won't make everyone happy, but it's all about movies set in **Kosovo** now. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: Since the competition for Italy is still running, I will refrain from updating the list here, which otherwise still follows, and instead I would like to draw your attention once again to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/).",

One group is probably a divorced couple, another group are experts of the upcoming disaster. Half an hour later, said disaster strikes. A few of the main characters die along with thousands of innocent people, which I failed to see how that’s entertaining. The characters that survived then try and survive until the next phase of the disaster, which happens in about 45 minutes or an hour. More of the main characters die and then the disaster is finally over. Those that survived talk about things like the divorce family getting back together again (as if) and rebuilding the famous cities that were destroyed, which would be pointless because they haven’t got the money.\n\nTHE END",

Selfish womanizing A\\*hole who makes millions on the back of others' misery lucks out on a wonderful inheritance and gets a beautiful girl. Which part of that was difficult, involved introspection and learning hard lessons about himself? Certianly not wooing Marion Cottilard, who submitted very easily after Max helped out waitering. His character really didn't change very much; just that he realised he'd made enough money and could now retire in his 40's in such an awful setting as Provence!\n\nIt needed to be a competent drama, because it wasn't particularly funny.\n\nSecondary to that, the subplot about the 'illegal' vines from California was wasted, and it didn't make sense to me. Why would his worker (Duflow?) try to mislead him? If Max thought the wine was beyond salvaging, that would only encourage him to sell to an equally untrustworthy stranger. And then after tricking Max, Duflow was disappointed he had agreed to sell a seemingly failing vineyard! Furthermore, one look at his Uncle's accounts would surely tell him this was not the case.",

I mean it got Jim Carrey so I kind of had the expectation that it would remain funny and light, the kind of comedy perfect for watching after a long day, having some good laughs, and then forgetting about it. That's not what happened.\n\nSome would say the movie remains funny to the end but I would have to disagree with them. It gets gradually darker and more serious. More philosophical, existential, sad, even in some ways violent and disturbing. \n\nLots of people like the movie and it got rave reviews when it came out, but I wonder if anybody else was a bit confused by the change in tone. Maybe a little unsettled. And whether that is exactly what the filmmakers wanted people to feel, to lure them in with the comedy so they let their guards down then slowly hit them with the deep questions about life and perhaps even about filmmaking itself.\n\nHave you had a similar experience with that movie or any other movie?\n\n",

I particularly enjoyed those shots that were filmed through the glass and with slow but fluid camera movements and soft lighting. \n\nAnd one last thing that really elevated the movie is the themes it addresses.

He's the reason why I saw it. \n\nI was looking at 1/2 star reviews on Letterboxd because looking at bad reviews of movies you love is funny. Anyways, a bunch of negative reviews of this say that Val, the son, is the biggest villain in cinema history and he's homophobic to his own gay parents and such. \n\nI've seen the movie a handful of times, and I don't see it that way. \n\nVal clearly loves his parents, he gives them a kiss when he comes home, he doesn't show hatred to them, or anything like that. Sure, he gives them little time to redecorate their home, but he doesn't call them slurs or such. \n\nVal has also clearly never made his family change before. He mentions to his Dad that when he was a kid, he was told that he should tell teachers that his father is a businessman, not the owner of a gay drag club. So, it was his fathers who have made him change in the past. \n\nIt's always been clear to me that Val loves his 2 fathers, and that the changes are to not turn away his to be father-in-law. If Val's fiancé's family was much more accepting of gay people, he wouldn't have done that. \n\nI've never seen Val as the jerk. Kevin always was. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nNote: I'm not saying that Val is completely justified in every action he does.  I don't morally approve of Val kicking Albert out, for instance. Like all good characters (in terms of writing), he has a character arc. But the Letterboxd reviews that say he's the worst villain ever? Come on, he's not Cruella De Vil! \n\n",

I like the leads Dwayne Johnson, Carl Urban and Rosamund Pike, but I enjoyed the newer movie more even though it had lesser known actors and I believe a lower budget.  I think it told the actual story better and was more similar to the games.  \n\nI saw a post earlier today about video game movies/shows where it was mentioned in the post or the comments that video game movies fail because they try to change too much, which pushes away gamers and doesn’t help a natural marketing base for the first viewers to recommend it to non-gamers. \n\nAt this point, I’m finishing Doom: Eternal, but if they made a movie of it, I think the best version would be watching YouTube videos of actual gameplay, with voice actors giving background narratives about all the stuff in the compendium/lore as needed and making jokes/Doom guy comments throughout.\n\nIf someone made the movie above and it’s free, I’ll watch that instead right now.  I might eventually pay for it (likely keep paying for streaming until it comes on, or start pirating again since everything is going ad supported)\n\nWhat is your opinion? Both on the two movies and video game movies in general.  I think resident evil did ok, but I haven’t played more than 2 & 3 I think.

I have heard about the John Fords, Kubrick's, Hitchcock's, Fincher's etc but I've never seen a director direct movies at scale like Ridley Scott and just churn them out. And whatever people think of his movies not many directors can direct a Sci-FI epic like Prometheus then direct a Cormac McCarthy drama like the Counselor, and then direct a biblical epic like Exodus then direct a hard science fiction comedy like the Martian in a 3 year span.

This comes as a complete surprise to him, he had no idea any of this was happening, he was too wrapped up in his work.\n\nThen he has to deal with suddenly being a father to his 9-year-old twins and his adult daughter from a previous marriage, who is pregnant.\n\nThis film put me very much in mind of Greyhound, a Tom Hanks film from a few years back. Both feature top-shelf stars who turn in a solid performance, both have a competent--if not terribly memorable--supporting cast, both have an OK--if somewhat predictable--story.\n\nAnd both are total, boring snooze-fests that suck two hours from your life and return nothing. Neither is actually a BAD film, it's just that there is no **there** there. In a way, that's actually *worse.* With a bad film, you can at least laugh about how bad it is.\n\nTurns out it's possible to make no mistakes and *still* fail.",

        "selftext": "I have searched for this. I cannot find it. i also realize memories from TV shows that long ago may be inaccuare. I doubt, however, that I could have imagined the entire episode.\n\nIn addition to their eponymous review program that created a genre that continues on YouTube, Siskel and Ebert used to show up as guests on talk shows. I recall one such occasion. I binged collections of them on Letterman and elsewhere. They were funny, spontaneous, and essentially the same as they were during their own thirty minutes sitting across the aisle from one another in the balcony of the theatre. That means they were not actors. They were not playing characters other than their true selves, to the extent we are ever observing on a screen a real identity.\n\nThe host, I thought Letterman but maybe Johnny Carson, wanted to ask each of them what he thought of the other. He had a pair of headphones or earmuffs. So the one not speaking would put them on. He then would not hear the other. Ebert spoke first. He was gracious and nice. He said, well, Gene and I don’t have the same tastes, but I respect him. Then Siskel spoke next. He was gratuitously nasty. He said, Ebert is an idiot, and I’m shackled to him now, forever. Or something along those lines. I was shocked at the difference. (I am not disparaging Siskel. I probably would be more like Siskel.)\n\nAnyway, if you have not seen them in these contexts, not on their own program, I recommend it. The Ebert documentary also is terrific, poignant.",

I could go on and on about the cool intricacies of the time loop paradox but what hit me the most was how sad Jane/John's story is.\n\nAll her life she wishes to be loved. The only time she experiences it, she is quickly abandoned by the man. The next time she experiences that love is as John when he comes back in time and realizes he is the man she falls in love with. John gets to experience the same love all over again, but is forced to abandon her knowing the pain it will cause. Then as a temporal agent, he has to set Jane and John up, knowing the outcome.\n\nThe final scene of the movie where he says \"you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I miss you dreadfully\" hit me the hardest. Realizing that he's talking about him/herself. The only love Jane/John have ever and will ever experience is from themselves. It's so strange and sad. \n\nI would argue that he goes insane and becomes the fizzle bomber to maintain the paradox, not out of self-preservation but because he wants to make sure the love he experienced happens. idk y'all it's just sad to me. The majority of Jane/John's life is spent in isolation, orchestrating some cosmic self-cestuous love story that barely lasts a few weeks. ",

It has to learn to survive and adapt, and it ends up forming relationships with the animals there.\n\nVisually the movie is very well done (something about it reminded me of Studio Ghibli films) and there are enough adventures to keep the young ones interested, and it's got some really funny parts too especially early on, but what really stands out is that the movie got heart and soul. It's a movie about friendship, love, and caring for others.\n\nI think this movie is worth your time, especially if you got kids, but even for grownups, you will get something out of it.",

        "selftext": "So, a few years ago, I was able to watch for the first time the amazing movie called \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and it blew me away. However, whenever I tried to read about it online, people only ever seemed to talk about the hellish production and how much of a bomb it was, which, sure, that's interesting, but no one seemed to discuss the story!\n\n  \nI don't know how many of you have seen this movie, but to me, its main theme is the phenomena of transmission. This can be seen with the Baron (who is supposed to be an in-universe fictional character) who starts the movie as a decrepit old man but, through his adventures with the young girl Sally, he starts to get rejuvenated, his hair unwhitens, his face uncrinkles, as he is being ressucitated through contact with the younger generation, much like a story.\n\n  \nI'm not sure how much of this theory is purely me overanalyzing the movie, but it seemed so obvious to me. The Adventures of Baron Munchausen tells the life of a story, of the way culture stays living. It's all about the importance of telling stories. In fact, this movie both discusses transmission and acts out transmission at the same time! \n\n  \nBecause who remembered Baron Munchhausen, the old german tall-tale-teller? I didn't. But that movie allowed me to learn about his existence and read his stories (which bangs btw go read it especially the version with the Gustave Doré illustrations). It was able to transmit the story of the Baron onto me, and so I have read some of his stories to my younger cousins.\n\n  \nAnyway, didn't really want to write such a huge wall of text, but I mostly wanted to discuss the story of the Terry Gilliam movie about the Baron. What do you guys think about the story? Am I just overanalyzing?",

However for some reason I'd been led to believe that it was a parody, like not satire but I had the impression that it was going to be a full blown comedy. \n\nSo when I was watching the opening scene I was just laughing because In my mind I was supposed to be laughing at how absurd this killer trope is supposed to be. For example, >!her hanging around and having a full blown chat with the killer and not calling the police, her picking up the phone again and again instead of calling the police, the killer saying theyre in the middle of nowhere when she was in her own house (i didnt know that the house was secluded) the comment about her bf being a huge football player etc. It was only towards the end of scene I started to think hold up this is pretty dark stuff 😂with her being dragged away as she's on the line with her parents and eventually gutted etc. !<\n\nAfter the scene ended I googled what people thought of the scene and how they found it so terrifying and then I found out further that the movie is actually a thriller just with satire embedded in it - so from that point onwards I enjoyed the movie the way it was probably intended. \n\nBut it got me wondering how I would have experienced the movie if I'd watched it as a comedy till the end and if there are other movies that I could have experienced differently.\n\nWas curious to know if this has happened to anyone else or am i just too dumb lol?

Great 80's soundtrack and cool visuals, especially the evil being. However the movie feels chopped in half and stapled back together, with massive jumps in story. It doesn't recover and so I understand the movie's low rating.\n\nI feel this movie would be perfect to remake. They could set it in Syria or Iraq where you'd have a similar play out with an ancient evil being released during the war and destruction of the cultural sites. Showcase some of the ancient Mesopotamian evil monster mythology. You could really play into the horror.\n\nWhat would be another example you feel for a movie deserving of a remake?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The mother was by far the most interesting character and although every character started off strong, it kind of fell flat as it got to the end. Charlie is also such a frustrating character to follow. I enjoy dissecting movies but this one was a snoozefest. ",

Why didn’t he seek out the feds? \n\n\nThanks.\n\nPS, this post has to be three hundred characters so here I am typing a few more words so that it gets approved. Do you think Christopher Walkens character in The Deer Hunter wanted to die because he was addicted to heroin? Another great film? Right? \n\nOk I think I’m at 300. Thanks for reading. ",

        "selftext": "Open to all but maybe most relevant to those of you who came of age in the 80s: what is for you the best early Rocky sequel after the original? This means no Rocky Balboa and none of the Creed trilogy...just the 11 year run from the first sequel in 1979 to Rocky V in 1990.\n\nIt's funny to think about it now but this was among the most common movie debates my friends and I had in our teens. I think we were all aligned on eg Indiana Jones, Star Wars but we always argued about this one.\n\nMost of the crew went for Rocky IV because of the the scary-ass Russian baddie. I think the Cold War vibes probably also made the stakes feel higher. But I could never get past Adrian being so negative the whole time, Paulie's robot and the Politburo applauding Rocky's speech at the end which seemed totally unrealistic even to a kid who embraced all the other ridiculous stuff from these movies.\n\nOn the other hand I was the sole supporter of Rocky III. What spectacle! Hulk Hogan in a charity match, plus Mr. T chewing up the scenery throughout. Rocky gets beaten badly the only time in the series, leading to Apollo training Rocky, the two becoming friends, and their friendly match at the end. And of course, the introduction of Eye of the Tiger.\n\nFor some reason nobody ever went for Rocky II. Maybe Adrian was too whiny, Rocky too obstinate, the win too telegraphed, the manner in which he wins unsatisfying.\n\nInterested to get a wider perspective - especially if someone wants to put forward the abomination that was Rocky V.",

But we never really see any details in the movie, where we see images of her with someone who might be meaningful to her other than her keeping a big portrait of herself in her condo (symbolizing that she is quite narcissistic)! \n\nIt really adds so much more depth to Elisabeth as a character on why she’s so lonely, and why she is the way she is! \n\nI look at Sue as a representation of what Elisabeth was like in her prime years when she was younger, and how fame more than likely got in her head to the point where she was losing all of those meaningful connections! Which resulted in her having nobody to really talk to about how she’s supposed to deal with her life moving forward, after Hollywood no longer cares about wanting her in the spotlight anymore. ",

As kids, we are more vulnerable, more honest, more able to express our feelings and I must say the first time I saw Stand By Me, I felt the movie was so honest and so real about how young teen boys interact with one another. \n\nThe four leads looked like your average kids and they didn't have perfect families, they all had something going on. Even Gordie, who seemed to have the most stable family life, was dealing with the loss of his older brother and being the \"invisible kid\" in his home life. \n\nThe four boys going on this adventure, looking for a dead body, ends up being a journey where they get to find themselves and grow up. By the end, you feel a change has happened. \n\nAnd it's such a sad movie. River Phoenix was in a league of his own, Chris had everything to be a Juvenile delinquent given how much of an outcast he was in the small town he was stuck in, and instead, he's the nicest and most reasonable boy in ther group, the one who tries to stop the fight and have everyone get along but at the same time, he was tortured by how rejected he was, to the point where he had his heart broken after being betrayed by a grown up, a teacher whom he trusted. \n\nAnd then that last scene breaks your heart. You never forget how impactful it is.\n\nAnd the narrator was right, you never get the kind of friendships you had at 12 as you have as an adult. I didn't understand that as a kid but as an adult,.

        "selftext": "I recently came across a poster for the movie 'Here' in which the camera apparently never moves for the entire film. This of course, is what I would call a gimmick. A gimmick is kind of like a unique stylistic choice or quirk that is supposed to make the movie different in some way. On rare occasions, the gimmick actually improves the story and serves a narrative purpose.\n\nExamples of gimmicks:\n\n1.The film '1918' purports to be a single continuous shot.\n\n2.The film 'Mank' is filmed in a way as to make it look like it's from the 1940s.\n\n3. The film 'Memento' is told backwards\n\n4.The TV film 'Bandersnatch' (from Black Mirror) has a pick your own ending type of setup where you can decide how the story goes.\n\n5. Quite a few modern films are filmed in Black and White to make them look more serious.\n\nIn my opinion, most gimmicks are used quite poorly but what are some examples where you think they were used very well and helped the storytelling?",

        "selftext": "Old I know, but I think the true problem with army of the dead's cinematography wasn't inherently the fact it had an extreme shallow depth of field (alot of the complaints like \"oh I can't see anything\" or \"erm, whuddabout the production design\" on their head are dumb to me as i am firm believer in obcuring things as long as what something is conveyed to the point of understanding in service to the larger picture but we'll get to how with from what I've gathered with aotd that's neither here or there), but rather, that it squandered the storytelling potential of such shallow depth of field by its effective use, by not using it for any thematic reason that could underscore the feeling of being in a post apocalyptic setting (something ironically enough explored way better in of all things, a dream sequence in Zack Snyder's Justice League), but instead was purely used for Zack Snyder's bastardized rule of cool that permeates so much of his filmmaking.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, there's literally no legitimate reason for the shallow depth of of field, It was done (as Zack said it) to \"hone in on the things he likes to look at\". Effectively, a self serving, masturbatory experiment with no hypothesis to prove. There was no vision, it was an ugly movie trying to be beautiful and that's where I'm going to make the argument that it could've justified being the way it was by going actually further than what they ended up doing and for an entirely different reason.\n\nWhat convinced me of what I'll say was seeing the vfx breakdown for this movie, where it showed a hard vignette from the canon dream lens as it does do that on the vistavision sensor of the red monstro he used, and I think it works in conveying how I think it would feel to be in such a setting, it had actually mood to me, where seeing the trailer and other released footage didn't have that.\n\nIt might seem so simple especially when by most measures it's a technical mistake but I believe that for the sake of everything in that movie, it would've been better to actually have intentionally sought out ugliness that even literal technical oversights like dead fucking pixels could've added to it. I think a cinematographer who is a master at that very thing in movies where that was the case and such ugliness added to the mood and elevated the stories like Lars Von Trier's breaking the waves and Danny Boyle's 28 days later was their shared cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle.\n\nYou know about 28 days later in which the camera choice punctuated the vibe of the movie, and you may know how Lars and Anthony worked by intentionally fucking with image by doing things like removing a color channel, transferring the 35mm film to digital to film back when that looked awful in service of elevating the ugly melodrama of it all by making it look ugly and thus conveying the feelings of it. What I'm trying to get at is there was salvation by actually bothering to write a reason by writing with the image to actually convey something instead of doing it for nothing.",

He shoots Alejandro through the face and I very much doubt that that was an \"intentional shot\". You don't get the feeling that this kid has ever used a pistol before and they're not easy to aim.\n\nMiguel seems to maybe be feeling a little bit of remorse about this and jumps off the truck when they're leaving.\n\nI initially thought this was because he realized that this thing he's gotten into isn't really what he wants to do with his life and he made a quick decision that ended up saving his life BUT then it cuts to \"one year later\" and he's fully tatted up with the hair-do and rolling \"full gangster style\". How did he get back into the gangs? I'm sure there's others but his cousin died, right? Along with all the people who knew him from the original group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he had a feeling something was going to happen to the group based on some \"spider senses\" he had going on from their meetings prior.\n\nIs this just bad writing or what were they trying to go for here? I don't understand his reasoning for jumping off of the truck but then going straight back into the same lifestyle again.\n\nThanks in advance. ",

        "title": "When it comes to Dwayne Johnson’s filmography, his films that feature wildly sweaty performances (Fast Five, The Rundown, Pain & Gain) have higher critic and user averages than his less sweaty performances. This isn’t great for Red One, but it’s promising for The Smashing Machine",
        "selftext": "This is insane. It really is; however, after watching the [*Red One* trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l3hfD74X-4) and seeing the first image from [*The Smashing Machine*](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1cx7e6g/first_image_of_dwayne_johnson_in_benny_safdies/)*,* I became convinced that there was a correlation between the sweatiness of a Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson performance and its impact (good or bad) on his career. Between T*he Rundown, Fast Five, Pain & Gain*, and *The Game Plan*, his career heats up when his body is trying to cool down. This is why I’m optimistic about *The Smashing Machine*, as it seems like Johnson is going back to basics to escape his recent VFX-heavy run. *The Smashing Machine* will be a sweaty reset – which is what Johnson has relied on for 20+ years of success. \n\nJohnson has made a career out of talking/posting/writing about his sweat. The tagline for his Under Armour collaboration is “[BLOOD, SWEAT, RESPECT](https://about.underarmour.com/en/stories/2018/11/blood--sweat--respect.html),” and when [talking about his career,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/young-rock-inside-dwayne-johnsons-turbulent-delinquent-pre-fame/) he said, “You gotta get up in the morning, you gotta get after it, you gotta put in the work, you gotta sweat. There’s gonna be heavy iron, and there’s gonna be a lot of sweat, and it’s gonna be dirty.” His Instagram posts almost always make sure to include the word “[Sweat](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Qr-GNyoYk/?img_index=therock).”. He’s basically worked sweat into his persona ([Sweat Equity ](https://www.instagram.com/therock/p/CQpiWpdFyRq/?hl=en)is his thing), so this data isn’t as random or dumb as you’d think.\n\nThe sweat levels should only go to 10, but after watching his movies again, I had to create an “11” category because there are a handful of movies in which Johnson’s sweat glands work overtime. To place each film in their respective categories, I rewatched his movies, looked for sweaty scenes/moments (Yes – it’s wild, but I had to follow the idea), and came up with a chart. It wasn’t too hard because, since 2017, I’ve been assigned a [handful of Dwayne Johnson data posts ](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/dwayne-johnsons-12-trillion-movie-damage-bill/)and research assignments, so they’ve familiarized me with his filmography. Also, if you're want to learn more about the data collection I recorded a podcast episode about it (Movies, Films and Flix pod - you can find it anywhere).\n\n* **Category 11 – Red** – The distribution makes me happy\n* **Category 9 – 10 – Purple** – on average, it’s the most lucrative category\n* **Category 5 – 8 – Green** – Hasn’t made a category 5-8 movie since 2017’s **The Fate of the Furious**. \n* **Category 0 – 4 – Orange** – 6 of his last 10 movies fall in this category. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pshv2wn5sv0e1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b210c750904264b8e3d997d8f364e0ac701180\n\nSix films fall into the 11 category: *The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain & Gain, Skyscraper*, and *The Smashing Machine* (it’s hypothetical). In their own way, these movies have proven important in The Rock’s  evolution as an actor and act as cornerstones of his filmography that have influenced his career.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown. I included longer explanations of their importance below, but these work as nice cliff notes if you are in a hurry or hate reading. \n\n* **The Rundown (2003)** – In an interview with [The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that when *The Rundown* was met with praise from critics, action fans, and general audiences, he went from “The Rock” to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson – which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously. \n* **The Game Plan (2007)** – After *Walking Tall, Doom, Gridiron Gang,* and *Be Cool,* Johnson needed a hit, which came in the form of the PG-Rated Disney film *The Game Plan*. Not only did it help him build a new fanbase, but it was his first non-action film to make more than $100 million worldwide. \n* **Fast Five (2011)**– Once again, after *Southland Tales, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy,* and *Faster*, Johnson found new management and reset his career path. He shaved his head, gained 30 pounds, and got mean again for *Fast Five.* This propelled him into the action stratosphere.\n* **Pain & Gain (2013)** – Not only does it feature his best performance, but it’s also his best R-rated film, and he will probably never play a character like this again. In 2013, both *Pain & Gain* and *Snitch* failed to clear $100 million at the worldwide box office – that hasn’t happened since. \n* **Skyscraper (2018)** – The movie underwhelmed at the box office and kicked off a new era of “immortal Superman” Johnson. It’s wild watching this film now and seeing a Dwayne Johnson character crying while cradling his daughter atop a burning skyscraper (don’t worry, Neve Campbell saves the day). \n\n**Here are longer explanations of why these films are important (if you read the above section, you can skip to the numbers below)**\n\n**1. The Rundown (2003)** – Johnson’s first starring role in *The Scorpion King* was a success, and it did well theatrically. Still, Johnson wanted other roles to prove he could carry a dialogue-heavy action film that wasn’t part of an existing franchise. Johnson took *The Rundown* role to step up his acting game and credits director Peter Berg as his “personal acting coach on set every day.” After watching the film, [Ebert gave it 3.5 stars](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown) and dropped this doozy of a compliment\n\n* [Ebert ](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-rundown)– “Early in “The Rundown,” The Rock enters a nightclub to confront some tough guys, and he passes Arnold Schwarzenegger on the way out. ‘Have a good time,’ Arnold says. It’s like he’s passing the torch. Whether The Rock will rival Schwarzenegger’s long run as an action hero is hard to say — but on the basis of “The Rundown,” he has a good chance.”\n\n* I like this David Shoemaker paragraph from his [Grantland](https://grantland.com/features/a-look-career-dwayne-rock-johnson-eve-wrestlemania-29-new-film-pain-gain/) days – “For the first time, Johnson feels like a legitimate star, but that’s mostly thanks to director Peter Berg, who understood that Johnson’s true talent was his humor. Rather than portray Johnson as a muscly automaton in some hard-boiled revenge tale, Berg made a grimy comedy and allowed Johnson to have fun. Even the fight scenes (of which there are many) are played for chuckles.”\n\nJohnson went all out ([he lost 20 pounds for the role to be more lean](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/)), and the positive reviews proved that he could headline a reasonably successful action film. It was a big step in his acting career, and in an interview with [The Boston Globe](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2004/04/02/the-rock-by-any-other-name-would-still-walk-tall/29712571007/), Johnson said that after acting in *The Rundown*, he went from “The Rock” to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson – which to him meant that people were starting to take him seriously.\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role**—He carried a critically appreciated action film and proved he could act alongside people like Christopher Walken. It was his first critically adored film and his only Fresh (60% or higher Tomatometer score) film for eight years (2003 – 2011). It’s still his highest-rated “Dwayne Johnson” film (*Hobbs and Shaw,* he’s a co-lead, and he’s part of an ensemble in *Fast Five* and the *Jumanji* films). \n\n**Best Moment(s)** – His character does wipe out an entire army, but it’s nice when he looks fallible. There are some good scenes [when he has his butt kicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJXF9gcUcNU&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&index=7&pp=iAQB), [gets harassed by baboons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdYPqVZIB9M&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut&index=6&pp=iAQB), and [rolls down hills](https://youtu.be/jKyhNbLEKxY?list=PLZbXA4lyCtqrLErljYah2rRpWvQANP9Ut). \n\n**2. The Game Plan (2007)** – *The Game Plan* was Johnson’s first $100 million grossing film since *The Scorpion King* (2002), proving he could headline family-friendly comedies. Johnson said he wanted to make a [movie that his daughter could watch,](https://www.blackfilm.com/20070921/features/dwaynejohnson.shtml) but it was mainly a smart pivot after *Doom, Be Cool*, and *Walking Tall* didn’t take off. It definitely boosted his box office marketability, and he went on to appear in *Get Smart, Tooth Fairy, Race to Witch Mountain*, and *The Other Guys* (which all grossed over $100 million). \n\n**Importance of Sweaty Role** – Johnson picked up a new fan base, and the role helped re-spark his career for a short time. \n\n**Best Moments** – He [cries](https://youtu.be/ZD8wDJKzEgY), [dances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFwBMwCOF-Q&pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl), [sings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQuA6Iobmqw&pp=ygUYdGhlIGdhbWUgcGxhbiAyMDA3IGRhbmNl), [sweats](https://youtu.be/XGQRDirweUM), [reads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI17vaYpW1A&list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&index=9&pp=iAQB), and [sings more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfKjInbMjnw&list=PLBtsbn2MpaQ83fKOnSR0dt4Wqwe7-QOR7&index=20&pp=iAQB). You can legitimately feel the desperation and willingness to do anything to make the movie work.\n\n**3. Fast Five (2011) –** *Fast Five* currently has his highest IMDb and Letterboxd scores of any Johnson film, and it legitimately propelled him into the big leagues. On the set of *Fast Five*, he told his makeup artist to [leave him alone and let him be sweaty](https://x.com/TheRock/status/1336855153719185408)—this paid off. \n\n[In an interview with Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a36037/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-0815/), Johnson said he had a moment of clarity in 2010 when he realized he had to “stop, readjust, reassess, and change everything around me—and I gotta take one more shot.” He needed to take one more shot at superstardom after years of movies like *Faster, Race to Witch Mountain, Tooth Fairy*, and *Planet 51* (*Southland Tales* didn’t help either), lowered his stock, and halted any growth as an actor. So, he changed up his management, and after years of talking to Vin Diesel about joining the *Fast and Furious* franchise, he shaved his head, grew an insane goatee, and put on [30 pounds of weight](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/9-rock-s-greatest-movie-roles-and-unique-body-he-brought-each-one/#:~:text='Fast%20Five'%20(2011),-Johnson's%20turn%20as&text=of%20crime%20fighter.-,After%20years%20of%20leaner%20roles%20in%20films%20like%20Tooth%20Fairy,doughy%2Dby%2Dcomparison%20Diesel.) (after years of being encouraged to lose weight) to play Luke Hobbs in *Fast Five*. The film was a gigantic hit, propelling Johnson into the action stratosphere. It’s worth noting that this is easily his sweatiest film – and probably his best action movie. \n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role** – He got mean again and kicked some ass. \n\n**Best Moment** – [He loses a fight to Vin Diesel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2PsfXZ3wyY&pp=ygUPZmFzdCBmaXZlIGZpZ2h0). This won’t happen again. \n\n**4. Pain & Gain (2013)** – *Pain & Gain* features Johnson’s best performance (he’s perfect in it), and it was nice seeing him back in R-rated territory after *Faster, Southland Tales*, and *Doom* didn’t click with the mainstream. Johnson accepted a massive pay cut (the main actors all did this for a cut of the backend) because he loved the complexity of the role, and it was a nice departure from his typical type of role. The film didn’t make much money, but it’s a beautifully sweaty (and nasty) piece of Michael Bay R-rated Bayhem. What’s interesting is that since *Pain & Gain*, he’s veered away from performances like this and, in 2018, said, “[No one’s going to see me play a borderline psychopath suffering from depression](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/dwayne-johnson-the-pain-and-the-passion-that-fuel-the-rock-630076/).” This is kind of a bummer because he’s given up on edgy performances that push him as an actor and instead dove into more safe comedies and action films. \n\n**Quick Note** – [During a 2024 GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024) he backtracked on his 2018 comments and said “I don’t know who the f\\*\\*k that guy is.”\n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role** – It proved he still had an edge and could push himself in non-blockbusters. Also, as Johnson said, “[The biggest departure](https://theultimaterabbit.com/2019/06/09/dwayne-johnson-on-getting-pumped-up-for-pain-gain/) (for me) was the vulnerability, showing this type of vulnerability and playing a character who is easily influenced and who’s just out of prison and looking for salvation.”\n\n**Best Moments** – [The neighborhood watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diiaCw3frzo&pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz) scene is wonderful. [He’s terrible at robbing banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8lQy1CTlZk&pp=ygUSUGFpbiBhbmQgR2FpbiAyMDEz), and [I’m pretty sure we’ll never see him grill a hand again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esg4w4b2xvc&list=PLZbXA4lyCtqr50cPGNoGN1w-TAWqYwpMr&index=10&pp=iAQB).\n\nOverall, it’s easily his best R-rated film. \n\n**5. Skyscraper (2018)** – *Skyscraper* didn’t make globs of money or achieve critical praise, BUT it features a different type of Johnson performance. SPOILER – At the end of the film, he’s sitting atop a skyscraper and awaiting his death while he clings to his daughter (he’s also crying, which is rare). At the last second, Neve Campbell saves the day and resets the skyscraper’s fire extinguishers. The movie received a lot of pre-buzz because Johnson’s character lost a leg and had to save the day with a prosthesis. It’s an odd choice (I guess it takes away from his superhuman prowess), but he went on an all-out promotional campaign and seemed to genuinely care about normalizing disabilities. \n\nInterestingly, this is probably the last time we’ll see this kind of character from Johnson. He tried to play a “normal guy,” and it didn’t work. He followed it up with *Hobbs and Shaw* (Hobbs becomes a superhero in it), *Jumanji: The Next Level* (plays a dude named Smolder Bravestone), *Jungle Cruise* (no spoilers – you’ll see), *Red Notice* (barf) and *Black Adam* (wildly powerful). They are miles away from his *Skyscraper* character and more in line with his over-the-top persona. So, even though *Skyscraper* wasn’t a hit, his decisions were somewhat altered because of its lack of success. \n\n**Importance of the Sweaty Role** – His plan didn’t work, and he slowed his film output. He played a major role in seven films between 2016 and 2018, and has appeared in six films in the last five years. \n\n**Best Moment** – [The finale of the film sees him cradling his daughter while they wait to be burnt alive (he’s also crying)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M06KzvYxlsc&pp=ygURc2t5c2NyYXBlciBlbmRpbmc%3D). He REALLY wanted to seem fallible. \n\n**Why do I think The Smashing Machine will be a sweaty success?**\n\n[Here’s a quote from a recent GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-men-of-the-year-cover-2024) – “It was also an opportunity for me, I realized, to stretch myself in ways that I hadn’t been stretched yet, and also challenge myself in ways that I hadn’t been challenged.”\n\nBetween *Red Notice, Black Adam, Jungle Cruise,* and the upcoming *Red One,* Johnson has taken a lot of flak for reportedly being the alleged reason for the swelling budgets and less-than-stellar critical and box office results (there are other reasons, of course…). His *Fast X* appearance didn’t light the world on fire either. So, when it was announced that he was going to star in the Benny Safdie-directed *The Smashing Machine*, a film adaptation named after the excellent 2002 documentary about MMA fighter Mark Kerr ([watch the doc – it’s awesome](https://youtu.be/-7DO5c7gWNw)) – I knew it was Johnson pulling a hard reset on his VFX heavy blockbuster run. When I saw the sweaty first image, it became obvious that Johnson was up to his old tricks he’s used throughout his career (hard resets and sweaty pivots). What’s funny is that Safdie and Johnson had talked about making the film since 2019, when Johnson bought the rights to Kerr’s story. Johnson admittedly [ghosted Safdie for several years](https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/dwayne-johnson-benny-safdie-mark-kerr-movie-1234940165/) (“Benny thought I ghosted him, and maybe I was just a f\\*\\*\\*in’ asshole”), but after years of not-so-great movies and a chat with Emily Blunt, Johnson called Safdie back, and now they’ve made the movie. Johnson says he hasn’t quit “four-quadrant blockbusters,” but he needed a career reset to explore films with more humanity. It’s a smart move – and it all points back to sweaty performances. \n\n**The Numbers**\n\nWhat’s really interesting is that his incredibly sweaty films have a slightly higher critical/user average than his less-sweaty movies. The differences aren’t anything big, but they prove that a little extra sweat helps.  \n\n**11 – Wild Amounts of Sweat**\n\n* Tomatometer Average – 55.2\n* Letterboxd Average – 2.9\n* IMDb Average – 6.5\n* Box Office Average  – $249 million\n* Movies – *The Rundown, The Game Plan, Fast Five, Pain & Gain, Skyscraper*\n* *Fast Five* has the highest IMDb score (7.3) and Letterboxd score (3.4)\n* *The Game Plan* was his first non-action film to clear $100 million worldwide\n* *The Rundown* was his first film with a Fresh Tomatometer Score\n\nThe biggest drawback to sweat-heavy movies is that they aren’t huge earners. However, when done right, they lead to bigger box office results. This is why Johnson is taking the role in the A24-produced *The Smashing Machine*. \n\n**9-10 – Sweat City**\n\n* Tomatometer Average – 54%\n* Letterboxd Average – 2.58\n* IMDb Average – 6.2\n* Box Office Average – $613 million (Aside from *Doom*, these movies make money. )\n* Movies – *Furious 7, Doom, Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw, Rampage,*\n* *Furious 7* is his highest-grossing film and most critically lauded\n* *Hobbs and Shaw* is his highest-grossing film, with only one co-lead (Statham)\n* *Rampage* is the fourth highest-grossing video game adaptation\n\n\n\n**5-8 – Gonna Need a New Shirt**\n\n* Tomatometer Average – 40.9%\n* Letterboxd Average – 2.48\n* IMDb Average – 6\n* Box Office Average – $268 million\n* Movies – *Hercules, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Walking Tall, The Scorpion King, Tooth Fairy, GI Joe Retaliation, The Fate of the Furious, The Gridiron Gang, Race to Witch Mountain, Faster*\n* *Note –* None of these films feature an overly excessive amount of sweat. \n* Only one of these films scores 60% or more on Rotten Tomatoes.\n* He hasn’t made a 5-8 category movie since 2017’s *The Fate of the Furious*. \n\n**0 – 4 – Zero to Light Sweaters**\n\n* Tomatometer Average – 53.2\n* Letterboxd Average – 2.72\n* IMDb Average – 6.28\n* Box Office Average – $356 million\n* Movies – *Southland Tales, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Jumanji: The Next Level, Jungle Cruise, San Andreas, The Mummy Returns, Baywatch, Fast & Furious 6, Snitch, Get Smart, Central Intelligence, Be Cool, The Other Guys, Empire State, Black Adam, Red Notice*\n* *Red Notice, Black Adam, and Red One* fall in this category, and they have a 38% Tomatometer average. Not great. \n* *Notes – Race to Witch Mountain and San Andreas* feature sweaty shirts but very little sweat. \n* *Jumanji 2 & 3* and *Central Intelligence* are all wildly popular and prove the Hart/Johnson connection is strong. \n\n**In conclusion** – *The Smashing Machine* is a smart reset for Johnson.\n\n**Make sure to check out my other Reddit data posts if you like this one!

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nyesterday, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Iceland. For me, it was initially exciting to see whether In *Bruges* would continue to be the only ‘foreign’ film on the list that is set in the respective country but is not genuinely from there. In fact, *The Northman,* which I thought of here, was quickly knocked off the list. Instead, it came down to another photo finish between two films that I hadn't even had on my radar because - to be honest - I hadn't even seen them before: ***Englar Alheimsins*** (engl.: *Angels of the Universe*) narrowly wins the race against *Sódóma Reykjavík* (engl.: *Remote Control*).\n\nNo matter which of the two would have won: Somehow I have the impression that the list (which you can also find on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/)) is increasingly dominated by films from the 90s and 00s. I'm curious to see whether this will also be the case today, when I swap the c for the r and now come to **Ireland**. As always, there are only two rules in this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "selftext": "**Crossing**: A Georgian grandmother named Lia practically forces her young adult neighbor, Achi, next door to drive her to Turkey so she can find her estranged niece, a transwoman named Tekla. This all has the makings of a light breezy road trip comedy and there are laughs to be had. But despite the rather familiar set-up, writer and director Levan Akin manages to craft more than just an escape for the characters, but how people try to find redemption in themselves. It's more than just Lia's search, it's about her own reckoning and guilt in having driven Tekla away. Should she be forgiven and is there even a relationship that can be saved? And Achi is more than dragged along for the ride. It's a chance from proper self-discovery for him. Even if it's not an escape from the working class trappings, maybe he could find joy and identity amidst the Turkish landscape. And for both of them, it's all the people the cross along the way, reflecting on what could've been, and how that drives us to redeem ourselves, even if we never get the chance to make amends. It's a film that's sensitive and human, but is also not out to provide comfort and safe answers for what we want. And with great chemistry from Lucas Kankava and Mzia Arabuli, it's a reflective film that's grown more and more with every reflection. Like the characters in the film, it's easy to take for granted the experience until you think about how much you gained by the end.\n\n**Daughters**: The winner of Sundance's top prize in documentary and one of the most acclaimed documentaries of the year for a reason. I was honestly amazed on how much I loved this film because this could've easily been your standard tearjerking shining of a light on a tragic subject matter (which a film like Sing Sing I felt fell into for the most part) but what's great about this film is it's more than reliant being telling you how cruel and unfair the U.S. Criminal Justice System can be. Rather than dictate again an uncaring and unjust reality and potentially feeling redundant, it goes further than what's shown and hits a cord I haven't felt with a documentary film in a long time. More than just compassionate and empathetic towards both the titular daughters as well as the fathers incarcerated, it's poignant but also not overbearing in its message of the importance of parents in a child's life. You get a sense of not only how deep and painful the separation has been for the families but also the genuine love the parents have. It's more than just finally being able to be connected and dance for a change, every word of regret and promise to stay strong for their children. And it's the understated presentation of storytelling that makes the eventual anger and sadness of the reality hit even harder than if they'd simply relayed the events. And for being the debut documentary for the program heads Angela Patton and Natalie Rae, it's beautifully filmed and edited. In my opinion, close to the peak of what modern documentary filmmaking can be, both as a medium of film and a medium of compassion and empathy.\n\n**Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World**: You know a film is incredible when an Uwe Boll cameo is one of the best parts. Without a doubt one of the sharpest and funniest satires about modern middle class I've watched in a while, I was a bit hesitant to get into this film at first given the nearly three hour runtime and I'll be upfront and say Raju Jade's dry, European sense of humor and their distinctly Romanian story with cute references to older Romanian media is not gonna be everyone's cup of tea. But despite the length, this is a film that captivated me for its runtime. I laughed hard at multiple sequences and scenes highlighting the absurdity of the state of the working class in an industrialized world in the 21st Century. Where even media and creativity is shackled and hindered by corporate desires and faux-sympathy for the plight of workers. So much so that escape and at times the only true authentic form of art is via co-opting of a masculine image through Instagram filters. And despite the humor, absurdity, and even bleakness of the reality, it's Jade's sensitive and empathetic direction towards the working class, combined Ilinca Manolache's effortlessly charismatic lead performance that keep you entranced. Even if this isn't normally your type of film, I still highly recommend this if just for an honest yet still tender satire.\n\n**Furiosa**: Okay, I'll admit that this took awhile to grow on me. It's a monumental task to try and follow something as epic and generation-defining as Fury Road. And while this doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessor, what I like is that George Miller simply didn't try and follow the same formula in telling another story. It's a lot slower and takes it times in setting up Furiosa and her path. We see more traditional worldbuilding not through action but through the other character interactions. Rather than the non-stop rush of adrenaline that the first film was, it's a film that builds and builds towards the big climax not just with the action but with Furiosa's eventual destination as the badass revolutionary we'd see her as. But at the end of the day, this is also yet another grand adventure in the Wasteland, with great thrilling setpieces, gorgeous cinematography and production, and a sense of creativity and wonder we don't see in a lot of modern blockbusters. Even if this is the end of the road and we never get another saga in the Mad Max universe, this is more than a fitting movie to end the series on, and an accomplishment of its own we got this in the era we did.\n\n**Green Border**: This is a film that'll be incredibly hard to watch and it took me several days to handle the subject matters. It's as blunt and direct as a film can be in presenting the current immigrant crisis at European borders, and at times, it does feel like it's juggling too many story threads in trying to be as thorough tackle as many perspectives on the refugee crisis from families fleeing to cruel border patrol to activists trying to rescue those caught in between borders. There's even a brief epilogue showing how the crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic that arguably could've been cut. At the same time, you can't help but feel the righteous disgust Agnieszka Holland has, appalled not only at her country but the larger European institution for allowing this to even manifest in the first place, let alone having it persist for more than a decade at this point. It's of no surprise she's been effectively blacklisted by her government. She holds no punches in showing inhumane behavior by border patrol toward migrant refugees, and especially pregnant women and children. Even the small handful of activists and legal counselors for those who successfully cross the border, can't help but feel small against the overall authoritarian European regimes. It's far from an easy watch or a movie to even recommend, but it is perhaps one of the more courageous films I watched this year, if only as a statement against the Polish government.\n\n**It's What's Inside**: It really is bewildering how Netflix can cheaply and quickly produce some of the worst films of the digital age while also helping promote and advertise some of the more creative titles. I already discussed Daughters earlier but let's talk about a film that surprised me even for one I was already excited about hearing about it out of SXSW and Sundance. The premise of a group of friends reuniting with each other only to switch bodies and have hijinks ensue, lends itself naturally to comedy, horror, and drama but it could also be played safe and cheap without tapping into its fullest potential. And I will admit at the sort I did have hesitancy after hearing the intentionally cringe influencer dialogue. But what I like is how quickly it breaks that safety net around the characters. That even the stereotypical jock bro or vapid influencer are fragile, seething and pathetic. How much do you really know about friends and partners? And if you feel betrayed by an image you had of them, how much of that blindness is their own sneaky behavior and how much of it is your own purposeful ignorance, trying to cling on to some image of stability. It's a fun watch, and one I'd imagine like the characters, would be even more fun with a group of drunk, high high school friends to be with. Also as a 100 fan, I always love seeing Alycia Debnam-Carey around, glad she's having fun.\n\n**Kinds of Kindness**: The lukewarm reception and even disappointment some had for this film after it premiered at festivals, even from Yorgos Lanthimos fans, reminds me of the reception to Asteroid City, in that I agree and see where the sentiment comes from but also disagree with the response as a whole. I will say that for fans expecting something on the level of Poor Things or The Favorite, you're gonna be underwhelmed and it's also not really a good entry point if you're unfamiliar with Lanthimos' work. It's a back to basics film for him, it's firmly within a safe, comfort house at least as far as his filmography’s concerned, and so if you're also not wowed by his aesthetic this will not be for you. I will also say that the three shorts aren't entirely consistent; the second story was by far my favorite while the third being enjoyable but flawed and the first sadly being my least favorite, with both a lukewarm story and presentation. But like with Asteroid City, I do think it's also a bit underrated because it doesn't feel like Lanthimos-lesser than. It's not just style for style's sake and it's not being weird just to be weird. There is still something primal about how this film will push its characters to show the lengths and boundaries will cross all in service of what they rationalize as love and kindness. It's at the point of being called cruel by others but it's just taboo to potentially alienate and distance those close to them. Plus the performances from Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, and Margaret Qualley - the latter of which continues to be an MVP in every film I've seen of hers. Even if it's not the best or most creative film, Lathimos still remains an engaging and eclectic filmmaker that at least guarantees that his movies are more interesting than most others this year.\n\n**The Last Year of Darkness**: From an outsider perspective, it's rather easy to wave off regular clubbing as a cheap, shallow form to escape nihilism. After all, mainstream culture for the longest time has degraded those who lived lives of vices, chastising anyone who'd even think of divulging in hedonism for a while. And to be fair there is some truth to the fact these are still business at the end of the day and we should indeed not solely live our lives based on quick highs. But I think waving these nocturnal places as 'dirty' and even 'worthless' is rather demeaning and this documentary proves why. After all, there is something to be said about a space within our world in the claws of urban globalized capitalism, where people regardless of race, gender, sex, and economic class are able to connect with each other, be in solidarity with each other face-to-face. Yes, one night of partying isn't going to solve anything - you're still having to go to your dead-end job, social communication with others, you're dealing with mental anxieties and depression. Yet wouldn't it be so much worse without places like Funkytown? That even the rare outing of happiness is better than unending misery in this world? Funkytown may be gone, the spirit of it lives on through communities and cultures that will continue in creating these spaces in the face of modernity and crushing capitalism.\n\n**Longlegs**: I've seen a lot more backlash to this film in the last few months than when it came out and I have to wonder how much of that was colored by the promotion and word of mouth. Now, was this help a bit too overhyped as the best and scariest movie of the year? Most definitely. Perhaps. And even amongst their young horror catalog, NEON's most successful film to date is not amongst their scariest (Possessor is still probably my favoirte horror movie they’ve acquired). But I do think separate from the hype, this is still effective and creepy horror movie. The cold, symmetrical cinematography from Andrés Arochi Tinajero, the creative and tight editing Greg Ng and Graham Fortin enhancing that unsafe feel, Maika Monroe's reserved performance in being able to show real fear, curiosity, and resilience as she herself wonders what happens if she gets too close to solving the mystery. And most of all the creeping dread and atmosphere Oz Perkins' creates; never leaving you feeling safe and secure even in public spaces and he properly makes night and day feel like a proper escape and respite from unknown horror. I can completely understand being underwhelmed from the hype and advertising, and ill even admit the final act and ending left me lukewarm in a Stephen King manner in that it explains a bit too much. But overall it's still a pretty great horror film in a year that's been great to horror, and a real showcase for Oz Perkins as a horror director to look forward to in the future. \n\n**No Other Land**: I don't typically say this of films but this is an important movie. Much like 20 Days in Mariupol, this is a documentary I had to watch in batches. Looking at the footage captured can't bring anything but contempt for the various governments around the world who've systematically aided in the genocide in Palestine (and don't at me in the comments, it is a genocide). There's no container for the level of anger that so many innocent families with young children have been forced to live in literally caves. Anger at all the senseless violence and murders that you can only get a hint of but is omnipresent throughout. Anger that basic human rights such as water are literally being sawed through via further disgusting acts of gentrification. It's a cruel and unjustifiable crime against all that's humane and the fact this is even being debated upon as such, is just as sickening. And yet through all the grief and pain of this documentary actually lies hope amongst the Palestinian families who've had to save themselves. A hope built from solidarity from each other but from the handful of Israelis that have stood by their neighbors and fought back against their own government. It's a hope that all this fighting isn't just all for nought, but that any resistance is enough to save whatever is still standing, and that more will come. That one day, they will be free. And for the sake of Palestine, and human decency, I too sincerely wish for that hope to be realized one day.\n\n**The Pop Out**: Does a majority of my love for this film come from the fact I love the music? ...I mean duh, why else would I or anyone watch it if they weren't fans of Kendrick? But being somewhat objective, it's not just the music here that's worthy of praise. Because this didn't just feel like they simply recorded a performance at a concert or Coachella performance, this properly felt like the big event and victory lap that it was. I love that it's not just Kendrick that gets a time to shine, but various other West Coast rappers. Even if it's not a film you'll necessarily watch from start to finish, it's one full of sets worth watching in their entirety. The fact it's great hip-hop is icing on the cake. And just as a time capsule for this moment in time in hip-hop, where a majority were able to stand in solidarity and unity even if it's all in shitting on someone as mediocre as Drake, is something to behold. I don't think there'll ever be another situation like this in hip-hop so being able to have this captured is something else.\n\n**Strange Darling**: Is this thriller a bit of style over substance? Sure I'll concede there. But when the style is this captivating, making the story all the more entertaining to follow through its complicated web, I have a hard time complaining about the style. I love how saturated the color palette is and how vibrant everything pops, particularly red and blues. Much has been made about how publicly the film was shot on 35mm - and perhaps it was a bit of a mistake to have a literal graphic before the film announcing that - but the results speak for themselves in how much grit you can get when you actually shoot on film. Not to mention Kyle Gallner continues to show why he's the modern Scream King. And Willa Fitzgerald who I was not familiar with at all delivers a wildly engaging performance. It's a film I can't talk much more on without hinting at spoilers so you should go into this film as blind as possible but the spider web we follow Gallner and Fitzgerald on is one that was incredibly enjoyable and I look forward to the J.T Mollner’s next film. \n\n**The Substance**: I think I've exhausted my love for this film on numerous different subs and if you really wanna know my full thoughts on this film, follow this[ link](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fs352y/the_substance_is_my_top_film_of_the_year_toptier/). I won't go into too much detail than I already have (and because I will no doubt continue to do so for years to come) but to summarize this is just a near perfect film in my eyes and the very peak of filmmaking this year. From the performances from the dual leads in Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley who give it their all, not just the body horror make-up, but the slow descent of a woman driven not just by society's standards of beauty but by her own years of self-hatred and loathing. To Coralie Fargeat's directing and editing style which takes the hyper saturated sunbaked colors, quick cuts, zooms, and exaggerated sound effects of her last film Revenge and blows them to glorious proportions. Just from a sensual perspective, this film is a rush of disgust and quick high that'll leave you giddy in how delirious it gets but there's also a level of control to it all that has to be acknowledged. To the story which is endlessly and gleefully fun with its dark humor and dissection of pop culture's fascination with sex, youth, and beauty. Yes, it may not be the deepest story ever but again it's presented and told in such a thrilling way that even if you guess the destination, it's a thrilling journey nonetheless. To a maniacally unhinged Dennis Quaid either unafraid to chew up all the scenery...or just unaware or how over the top and unintentionally hilarious and threatening he is (honestly either is possible). Again I've talked A LOT about how much I love this film and I will talk more about how awesome it is for years. This film more than lived up to the hype and I instantly will be first in line for Coralie Fargeat's next movie.\n\n**There's Still Tomorrow**: The film that made rounds last year for being the highest grossing Italian film of last year, even outgrossing Barbie in Italy. And after waiting a year to be able to view it, it more than lives up to the hype. And like with Barbie, it's a tough balancing act between the dreamlike tone of the setting and the comedy against the very real sexism and patriarchal society of a post-World War II Italy. The sets may look cheap and inauthentic but that actually adds to a classic Hollywood feel the film creates that enhances the unfair reality of the culture at the time. And yet thanks to the confident direction that never feels too heavy handed, and the performances from actresses not just the director Paola Cortellesi in the lead, but Emanuela Fanelli and especially the eldest daughter played by Romana Maggiora Vergano, it is able to showcase the gravery and grit of the Italian women in WWII to have their dignity not seen but adequately recognized. Plus, this contains without a doubt one of the best needle drops of an Outkast song ever put to film. You'll know it when you hear it and it actually had my jaw drop at how ingenious the incorporation was. \n\n**The Wild Robot**: It's being called the best animated film of 2024 and even if this year was as competitive a year as 2022 or 2023, I think this would still be a contender for one of the best within the medium. As expected, the animation is beautiful with the hand drawn storybook art style carried from The Bad Guys and The Last Wish, meshing beautifully with the story. And something I quite like is the expressions and movements. They remind me of WALL-E jn how they're expressive but nor overtly cartoony as to look like it's just human faves on an animal or robot. The voice acting is also really strong: from the lead performance Lupita Nyong'o to Pedro Pascal to even side actors like Bill Nighy and Catherine O'Hara, for once in a Dreamworks film it doesn't feel like a collection of actors in a studio doing their public schtick. These feel like proper cartoon characters given life through their performances. And the story of adoptive parenthood and even feeling like an ourcasy who just wants to help (with more than a little autistic coding towards Roz) while not groundbreaking, still has a lot of warmth and authentic emotion as the best of any family movie should. It does get a bit complicated at the end with a sudden shift towards action for it's final act (an issue a lot of Western animated films have been having for years now) but that's a nitpick. Glad to see Dreamworks back on track\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ts6j7fcdu0e1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b5d374af7bf5758b4a92d9eaf79447c9ab54693",

        "selftext": "They focused way too much on Jack Sparrow.\n\nI don't wanna hear any smartass reply on how \"then they wouldn't have been successful\". That's not what this is about. \n\nThe first film wasn't the best film ever made but it was enjoyable for what it was. The production values,  the sense of fun, and Geoffrey Rush are what made that film what it is. Jack Sparrow worked as a supporting character but he wasn't the lead; Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann were. Their love story is right up there with Peter Parker and Mary Jane, Shrek and Fiona, Sam and Mikeila, Homer and Marge, etc. Will & Elizabeth were the heart and soul that grounded the film while Sparrow was the side attraction. \n\nWhen the sequels focused more on Sparrow, it felt like that Simpsons episode where Homer created a character to help Itchy & Scratchy's ratings and he'd ask \"Everytime Poochie's not on screen, a character has to say, 'Where's Poochie?'\". Everything has to revolve around him for some reason. It was ridiculous and made him a Mary Sue. It didn't help that none of the films developed Sparrow. He was a completely static character. Even Optimus Prime in the Bayformer movies had more character development. So watching him as a lead was simply boring and it ultimately became an excuse to stroke Johnny Depp's massive ego.\n\nThese sequels could have been so much better. Just focus on Will & Elizabeth, develop them as characters, focus less on spectacle and more on story, I guarantee you, the films still would have made money. Not saying Sparrow not be included; they just needed to stop idolizing him.",

Economic hardship, food shortages and government corruption all contributed to disillusionment with Czar Nicholas II. Finally, in 1917, the Russian Revolution toppled the Romanov dynasty, and Nicholas II abdicated on March 15, 1917. During the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks, led by leftist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, seized power and destroyed the tradition of czarist rule.

'HUGO' is more family-friendly and suitable for young adults.

However, I found the D-Box seats more comfortable and appreciated the larger gap between our seats and the ones in front, which added to the overall comfort.",

        "selftext": "I was looking through Netflix for something to watch last night and saw that they had recently added Logan Lucky. I hadn't seen it since its release in 2017 and I didn't have it held in the same regard that I do other Soderbergh movies, so I figured it was due for a rewatch to see how it holds up. By the end of this watch, I just couldn't shake how this film leaps forward to capture our world today. It's frankly impossible to watch this movie as an American after the events of last week and not come away with a firm understanding that this a picture of the rural, red part of the states, and also this is an incredibly fucking hard way to live and a tough way of life.\n\nThe entire cast of this movie gets to something that so many other movies set in the Midwest (EDIT: Not Midwest, WV and NC are both states in the south) miss in their tone, the exhaustion of it. It's exhausting for Channing Tatum to work a state away from home, and always be rushing to his daughter, and this bad knee he can't afford to ever get right. Watching Adam Driver portray an armless veteran who still can't get ahead in life because of jail time he did as a teenager is so quietly brutal. Even Daniel Craig as the Popeye-esc explosives guy has moments of real softness that connect throughout. You see it through this whole unbelievably stacked cast, truly the names in these credits are absurd, these parts of the states are beaten down, and as big industry continues to suck the money up the chain, the people are exhausted trying to keep up. It's shown plain and simply, and really who could blame the Logan's for seeing an opportunity to get ahead for once.\n\nEven in a performance I didn't love, Seth Macfarlane as Max Chilblain, he's literally an International billionaire who has forcefully made himself way too big a deal in the lives of Americans. He has decided through sheer annoying willpower to be a part of this story, and honestly that is so on the nose that it hurts my head.\n\nIf this post is to say anything, it's that I highly recommend revisiting Logan Lucky if not seeking it out for a first time. It's wonderfully made, incredibly written by Jules Asner, and can be watched as a compelling Dukes of Hazard meets Oceans Eleven thriller. But I couldn't help but approach it knowing that it's a story that gives a look into what's actually going on day to day for people living in parts of American that I'm sure feel lost in lots of our national discussion. It's entirely possible that this an overly sincere look and I'm reaching for a hand that doesn't want to be held, so let me know if so.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone pointing out that this movie doesn't take place in the Midwest since WV and NC are both southern states, that's totally on me. Should've double checked with a map before hitting post. ",

The isolation, the barely perceptible bear chuffing in the background as he walks, the reveal of the bear cubs walking in front of him as the camera swings around to show the mama bear on her hind legs before she charges with full abandon. Then just 5 straight minutes completely helpless as this absolute beast mauls the shit out of him.

The film was directed by Tim Everitt. Using the Internet Archive I was able to find a page from his site that stated that animation work begun in August of 2018 and was scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2020 (this appears to have been sitting on the shelf for years). That page also compared it to The Land Before Time. It is also listed as picked up by Grindstone Entertainment Group on the MPA bulletin.

The music was surprisingly great and that was the actual highlight for me. I did like Beyonce as Nala. Just my opinion though.\n\nThe visuals were beautiful to look at but I couldn't help but feel it was just a lesser version overall. From actors to pacing and the whole vibe.\n\nLittle Mermaid was...just not good. Again musically it was great but otherwise it just felt like a hacky remake. The visuals were not enjoyable nor the characterisations. Halle did the best she could with what was given.\n\nMulan. Well that's been beaten to death but I actually enjoyed it for what it is. I can't explain beyond that.I like how it took itself seriously and for some reason I couldn't compare it to the original as much. \n\nBeauty and the beast was just strange for me. I genuinely didn't enjoy it. Also I watched Sideways music analysis on the movie which helped bring out the flaws more.\n\nAladdin. I actually enjoyed it and the outfits were incredible. Jafar was not it though. Easily the weakest link.\n\nI do like how Will Smith made it his own but no one can replace Robin Williams. Out of all the remakes. This is the one I enjoyed the most, flaws and all. \n\nI do wish some of Guy Ritchie's personality came through more just because his British humour gets me but alas. Actually the Nordic prince was definitely his humour coming out.\n\nAnd that's how far I've gotten. Again these are my opinions.\n\nEdit: I haven't seen all of the remakes but to complete this post.\n\nI really enjoyed Cruella when I saw it awhile ago. Emma Stone is great at the accent and I really felt immersed in that world. Some dodgy CGI but overall a truly good film.\n\nI didn't enjoy Alice in Wonderland. Weird CGI and it felt...sickly? I felt actively turned off from it.\n\nI haven't seen Maleficent. Maybe soon.",

        "selftext": "So first off, awesome movie. But I won't spoil too much. However, I will say that movie does give it's 2000s nostalgia and it's amazing how far we've gone. \n\nSeriously, it's weird, given the fact that the main character would still be younger than me, and I was going to be a senior as soon as school starts. I'm sure there's older people here. \n\nLike seriously, the references to MySpace, early Facebook, early YouTube, flip phones, etc or references to movies like Superbad or A Walk to Remember or references to bands like Paramore. I don't know how much it captured the vibe of 2008 considering my memory is pretty hazy, but it definitely made me feel like in the 2000s. I was already feeling old by the time 90s nostalgia came, and look where we are!\n\nAnd it's not exactly that soon. I mean, GTA: Vice City came out in 2002 and takes place in 1986. That's the same time gap between that movie and it's setting. VC was clearly coming off the heels of the 80s nostalgia going around that decade. That's the reason why there's all sorts of memes about thinking about the 2000s today would be like thinking about the 80s in the 2000s. \n\nDo you think by the 2030s, we will have 2010s nostalgia?",

Overall I love it, I felt this vibe when you're younger you have not even try a beer or a cigarrete but when you some people doing it you think they're cool. Youth.\n\nSex is very explicit, enjoyee those moments, but to talk with truth it was like 50% of the movie if might sound too much for some people, for me in consideration that I was precisely looking for something like that, it was nice.\n\nLove photography, characters, colors, angles, music basically all.\n\nBut I'd like to ask you about this concept:\n\nIs the movie trying to romantize threesomes FMF and, MFM? This part in which the policeman is teaching this guy to not own his girlfriend, instead find ways to try new things with other guys, I do not see the point, at the very first minutes the two of them agreed, their ultimate fantasy was to \"f\\*ck with another girl\"",

        "title": "ANORA -- and why her ethnicity mattered",
        "selftext": "Like many of you, I was SO excited to watch Anora from the moment I heard about it; but perhaps for a different reason. \"Anora\" is a very very traditional, old-school Uzbek name. It's a name your grandmother that was born in an Uzbek village would have (compare it to a name like Bertha, or Doris). Most importantly, it's a name that's generally recognizable to Russians as being Uzbek, or Central Asian at least.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Uzbeks were the third most populous ethnicity right after Russians and Ukrainians. During the USSR, Uzbeks (and Central Asians in general) were seen as backwards savages compared to Slavs. Since the dissolution of the USSR, over a million Uzbeks reside in Russia as migrant workers. They face A LOT of racism and legal discrimination to the point that it's very common for most Russian landlords to explicitly advertise that they won't rent to Uzbeks. To put it plainly, Uzbeks are perceived pretty negatively and they're looked down upon in Russia. Uzbek women in particular also have a stereotype in post- USSR countries, as well as places like Dubai and India, as being prostitutes.\n\nThis is why I thought it was so brilliant that Anora in the movie was going to be Uzbek. Every single review or article about the movie initially said that she was Uzbek, so I was surprised that it was never mentioned in the movie. I recently read an article with the director however that Anora is supposed to be Russian, which honestly takes away a lot from the movie for me. It would have made so much more sense why Anora had the relationship with Russian that she did, and it would give yet another reason why Vanya's parents didn't accept her. The USSR racism against Central Asian carries over to post-USSR communities in the US. Brighton Beach, where the movie takes place, is home to half of all Uzbeks that reside in the US. I grew up going there a lot, and I remember feeling slightly embarrassed and ashamed every time I would go to Russian markets or restaurants because I'd get dirty looks for being visibly Uzbek. I always refused to identify with anything Russian even though my parents were from the USSR and raised me with a lot of Russian media/culture. I just didn't feel comfortable having anything to do with it when so many Russians looked down on my people.\n\nSo if you take the fact that Anora is a sex worker and combine it with the fact that she is from a \"low-class\" culture in Russia, doesn't it make even more sense why Vanya's mom was soo mean to Anora and rushed over there? And why Anora wanted Vanya to approve of her and defend her so badly? \n\nAlso, I just can't believe it's a coincidence that Mikey Madison looks remarkably central asian compared to the average Slavic Russian, and she was given a Central Asian/Uzbek name in the movie. I wonder if she was initially supposed to be Uzbek-American, but that aspect was later changed due to a fear of backlash from the Central Asian community? Anyways, I hope this can add some context to y'all.",

On the flip side, incredibly dumb and pure fluff movies like The Kissing Booth - again, don’t kill me here, ha, ha, ha! - also help me, though maybe not as much as the true crime stuff. \n\nSo feel free to play armchair psychiatrist and chime in on my odd form of therapy. \n\nThank you.

Its not only a better option when checking to see the publics opinion on whether or not a specific movie or show is something I want to watch, its also a place I can return to in order to view peoples opinion after the fact. Personally, im interested in what the critics have to say, and IMDB is the perfect place to hear opinions straight from the masses from ppl just like you and me. Also, i believe Rotten Tomatoes scoring system is based on a thumbs up or thumbs down kind of thing. Did you like it or did you not. Whereas IMDB gives you a 1-10 scoring system. So you may have liked it, but didn’t love it. Therefore, you can give it a 6.7 rating. It’s a much better and more objective way to rate the movie or show. It’s far more helpful when scouring around to find something to watch, and much more enjoyable to hear everybody’s thoughts after i have finished watching. Am i alone on this?

        "selftext": "I'm sure there's a more specific term for what I'm looking for, but I guess in general I'm thinking of the old school style of films about some kind of spectacular or otherworldly/apocalyptic event, but the focus remains on a smaller group of characters where the film is more about them dealing with it and trying to discover if it's really happening, as opposed to a Roland Emmerich-y type of disaster porn. I guess here's some examples I could think of;\n\n\\* Knock at the Cabin - Good example of the structure I'm talking about, has the classic \"characters watching a disaster news report on TV\" and questioning whether the apocalypse is really taking place.\n\n\\* Invasion of the Body Snatchers - I specifically watched the 1978 version recently but I absolutely loved it and it's probably the closest to what I'm thinking of. The atmosphere and ambience in this one was off the charts, it was genuinely creepy in a way I wasn't prepared for and I really want to watch it again.\n\n\\* Night of the Living Dead - I've watched this one once or twice now, I really just love how 'classic' it is all the way down to the bones. In this case I think it's characters listening to a radio broadcast a la War of the Worlds, but still manages to instill that sense of encroaching danger and the idea of the world ending without showing it.\n\n\\* The Birds - A big part of what makes this creepy (imo) is the ending, with how unresolved everything feels and how uncommon that felt for old movies. I watched this one when I was younger, so I was much more accustomed to old fashioned movies always wrapping everything up in a neat little bow, complete with the closing story book saying \"the end\", whereas this one just ends with the characters slowly driving off into a dangerous, uncertain future. I remember really having a feeling of \"that's it??\", but not in a bad way. \n\n\\* Contagion - This one obviously shows a little more of the action taking place and isn't contained in the same way, but I love how it depicts the events and meetings in such an uncharacteristically 'non-Hollywood' way; the best scene I can think of as an example is [the one where they actually explain how the virus works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86DW14ba8xo). In a traditional movie, we can imagine this as a big 'war room' with scientists in lab coats and military experts all gathered around a smoky room with a big dramatic slide projector showing the spread of the virus, whereas here it's a normally lit office room with two characters rationally explaining the way this works on a regular Windows computer screen. It feels unnerving because it no longer gives us the veil of 'a movie', it feels closer to  the experience of being in an actual doctors office and having them explain something to you, which in my eyes makes it far more unsettling and 'real'.\n\n\\* Testament - One of the other favorite examples of this that I rarely ever see talked about, an early 80s film about a nuclear war where the only 'special effect' we get is a flashing light in the window, followed by a typical suburban family forced to deal with gradual decay of civilization. It's one of the most punishingly bleak films I've ever seen, and manages to create some pretty gut-level dread with nothing more than implication, never even needing to resort to violence to make an impression which I find impressive. \n\nAnyways, I feel like that probably gets the gist of it across, I'm looking for more recommendations of stuff in this ilk, specifically 60s-early 80s, but open to any time of course. Thanks y'all! \n\n",

        "selftext": "So, I'm from India and I love watching videos related to movies, especially if its related to Hollywood. And I dream of becoming a filmmaker in that industry one day. And I have been thinking about actually watching Hollywood movies both to understand how the industry works and just for some entertainment.\n\nBut that's where the problem comes, there just seems to be soo many movies that I don't know where to start. And that's why I'm here. I want to ask you guys which movies I should watch first as a beginner into the Hollywood space.\n\nNow to be specific, I HAVE seen a few hollywood movies in the past, I've seen The Mask and pretty much all Pixar movies and also Into the Spiderverse, but that's it really. I still haven't seen like 99% of all that hollywood has.\n\n  \nI want you guys to suggest me some movies that I start with to get invested into Hollywood.\n\nBut I am looking for movies that follow a few of my personal requirements:\n\n1. The movie has to be rated PG-13 at most. Don't suggest R-Rated movies (cuz i'm too young and a coward).  \n2. It has to NOT be from Pixar (once again, i've seen all of them already)  \n3. You can suggest movies that have released this year already, but I'll be more leaned in towards movies that at least like a year or two old.  \n4. I want them to be available on streaming, so maybe don't suggest movies that are in theatres right now, I don't feel like going to a cinema atm.\n\n5. You can suggest animated movies but I'm more preferring to watch live-action movies first.  \n6. It has to be a pretty popular movie that a good amount of people know about.\n\n7. And finally, don't recommend MCU films, I'm not watching like 56 movies in order right now.\n\nSo that's it, please give me ideas, thank you.",

And my goodness, it was really exciting to see which film would be the 20th entry there: We truly needed a photo finish again: I would have found it exciting if an older film had won again with *A tanú* (engl.: *The Witness*), but the truth is, that *Kontroll* lost because of a single up- or downvote against ***Sátántangó***.\n\nWhen I look at the running time of the movie, I'm still not quite sure whether I've fallen for a prank here. But the next winner will probably be a somewhat shorter film. We are looking for the favorite movie set in **Iceland**. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls",

        "selftext": "So in both in Hollywood and the American Indie cinematic world I’ve seen a lot of films advocating for representation, but most of them  are about representing Blacks, East Asians, or Latinos.  Nothing else beyond that. The film studios are trying very hard to push Black and Asian representation in superhero movies and the Oscars: Blacks and Asians are the only “minorities” that get awards. Occasionally South Asians/Indians. However, I have never seen any stars Middle Eastern or North African descent get big. And Middle Easterns were not known for being portrayed in Hollywood in a positive light (see American Sniper, Zero Dark Thirty, and the use of white actors in brown face to play Middle Easterns like in Lawrence of Arabia). What’s wrong with Hollywood having beef with Arabs and Middle Easterns and Islamic People? ",

Just seems like a film that anyone over like 15 at a push is not gonna enjoy as has aged like milk, which is strange because again I enjoyed this film when I wad younger \n\nAnyways kings of summer is probably the best coming of age films ever and still hits emotionally deeper than perks of being a wallflower without trying anywhere near as hard.

So, for example Marx's theory of alienation, or Comte's three stages of society, or Weber's definition of power and the types of authority, etc. (note that it's a classical social theory class, so from Montesquieu only up to Weber, no modern theorists).\n\nIt doesn't have to be the whole movie's theme. It can focus on a single character, a part of the film, even a scene, as long as it is powerful and meaningful enough for a 3.5-5k essay. 🥲\n\nSoo, do you have any suggestions please?

        "selftext": "I absolutely loved Stories of Your Life and Others! This short story collection was something new for me. I usually gravitate toward longer works, so I wasn’t sure what to expect from these shorter pieces (the only other short story collections I’d read were the first two Witcher books). But wow—these stories were perfect. They never felt rushed, nor did they overstay their welcome. Each one felt like its own immersive journey, with just the right balance.\n\nThe collection is rooted in science fiction and speculative fiction, my favourite genres, especially when there’s a philosophical twist woven into the plot. Chiang’s writing explores big ideas without feeling heavy or overly abstract—it’s like he makes you ponder the universe while staying grounded in the human experience. I think that’s what made this such a standout read for me.\n\nIt’s hard to choose a favourite, but “Tower of Babylon” and “Liking What You See: A Documentary” are definitely at the top. “Liking What You See” especially blew me away; it’s structured like a series of interviews, capturing students’ opinions on a topic that’s both futuristic and unsettlingly relevant. It almost reads like a real documentary, with a journalistic feel that makes it so vivid and believable. This unique style pulled me right in and kept me thinking about it long after I’d finished.\n\nAnd, of course, I have to mention “Story of Your Life.” I’d seen Arrival a few times (Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite directors!), and I was thrilled to read the story it was based on. Villeneuve’s adaptation is phenomenal—he captures the core of the story while adding his own cinematic magic, especially with the tension and atmosphere he brings in with the military storyline. The film nails both the personal and the universal themes in Chiang’s work and if you’re a fan of Arrival, you need to read this collection. The story is just as poignant, and so are the others in their own way.\n\nAfter being blown away by Ted Chiang, I’m all in for more short story collections. I’m thinking of trying Neil Gaiman’s Smoke and Mirrors or Fragile Things since I love his writing style. If anyone has other recommendations for short stories, I’d really appreciate them—drop them in the comments! I’m eager to dive deeper into this format now.\n\nEach story in Stories of Your Life and Others is breathtakingly unique, tackling themes that range widely but always hit home. They’re impactful, making you think about the human condition, the possibilities of science, and new ways of looking at the world. It’s a quick read that’s also deeply satisfying, leaving you with a lot to ponder.\n\nI can’t recommend this collection enough. I loved it! If you’ve read it, let me know which story stood out to you the most—I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nCheck out more reviews on my blog: https://blog-on-books.blogspot.com/",

It’s so refreshing to watch a movie that understands and respects its premise and delivers in a unique, unexpected way. Each character is complex and layered, some are despicable, some are reasonable, and their interactions among one another are unforgettable. An absolute must watch, it would take pages and pages to fully discuss how incredible this movie is but I urge anyone seeing this to not be afraid of its age; it’s utterly timeless and could pass for a movie released in the 90s.",

        "selftext": "OK, not trying to get into spoilers too much or anything, as I do think this movie is one you should check out. With that being said, this, to me, felt a little like \"The Substance at home\", mixed with similar elements of David Lynch (Eraserhead in specific), as well as, elements of Blade Runner, both Cronenbergs (Jr./Sr.), Brian Yuzna films like Society, the \"It's Alive\" franchise, and weirdly enough Private Life with Paul Giamatti. A little preachy with its message, is what I would have said minus the last like I don't know, little bit, like 10 minutes or so, but again I'm trying to avoid spoilers, just want some discussion, so be warned below in the comments people will be talking about spoilers as well, just go watch this and come back. Point is, you can really contextualize the parts of this movie to fit a plethora of different narratives. I'm more into the visual style and cool claymation/stop motion sequences, also the body horror and the art house mood/tone. Letterboxd link below movie for info. Thanks again !",

The thing I wanted to know is about Sean's wife, I don't understand her part in the story, like is she just there to give depth to the character? So that in a movie not everything has to be part of the main story but they give a lot of time and importance to her calls to Sean and also to the mystery and I don't understand why. So I know why she was doing it, to \"test Sean\", wait for his first move and reunite but it seems like it's not part of the story, it seems like a subplot for a whole other story about Sean. The three main characters are equally important, I don't question that but Sean sometimes seems more like an outsider in the, like only a way to represent the reason and justice that Jimmy and Dave lack. I tried to think about it and maybe the wife was just a metaphor to show how Sean feels too much and like he detached himself from his wife therefore he detached from his friends, old life after the dave incident? Everything from dave and jimmy lifes were linked in some ways and also the main plot events but Sean expect for being the Detective and being spectator of dave's kidnap had \"nothing\" to do with them. Like im okay with it but I wanted to know if there is a meaning behind this and if the wife is there to explain this. Thanks ",

I see the mechanical nature of human thinking reflected in the fact that the second part has to rise above the first part by standing on exactly the same pillars as the first part. I wonder how critics would assess the film if they did not put it on a par with the first part, but saw it as a film in its own right, without precedent? I wonder how many \"second parts\" or \"third parts\" in the history of cinema have failed because they fell victim to this comparison?  What do you think? Does a first part impose an obligation on the creators of a second part to rise above it in every respect, or are they worthy of being seen by critics as a work in their own right?",

But Tom Cruise is just so good that he turned the movies past GP in blockbuster hits. \"The Final Reckoning\" seems to be the swan song. Do you think they should continue? If so, how? Personally I think the MI franchise is synonymous with Cruise so I don't know who could possibily fill those shoes nor do I know any actor who would even dare, given the crazy stunts that come with the terrirory. But they could go the James Bond route, do a full reboot and recast Ethan Hunt. With the right writing team and the perfect lead who has charisma in spades they could turn Ethan Hunt into the american James Bond. The elements are all there. Crazy gadgety spy world, stunts that make you sweat and keep you on the edge of your seat, awesome fight scenes (who can forget Cavill reloading his arms), Ethan's girls. Yeah I'm team reboot.",

Second place would perhaps go to In the house in a heartbeat from 28 days or Lux Aeterna from Requiem for a Dream. If I really had to choose from songs, I’d perhaps have to settle with My heart will go on from Titanic. ",

Would films like The Patriot, with its focus on the American Revolution, or even Top Gun in its original 1980s form, feel out of place in today’s movie landscape?\n\nI’m curious what movies you think fit this idea. Can you think of popular films from the past that were very “American” in their themes, humor, or tone—films that might get reworked or not made at all today? Let’s hear your examples!",

They cut to Rebecca De Mornay’s character just staring at her with this cold, psychotic expression. And then that last scene, where the woman is scrambling for her inhaler—I remember how scary that felt, watching the adults in the room freak out as she struggled to breathe.\n\nDo you remember any other 90s movies you used to watch with adults.",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than two weeks, I ask you for the most favorite movie set in a certain european country. Yesterday, it was Greece's turn and in keeping with the fact that there seems to have been a little or a lot of hype surrounding the director of *Poor Things* since the release of this same film, another film from his portfolio has won: ***Κυνόδοντας*** (engl.: *Dogtooth*).\n\nI had thought of a certain Alexis beforehand, but it seems that newer films are winning more often than I might have bet on. I can't wait to see whether the next country will be the same: It's about movies set in **Hungary**. As usual, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

Yes the production style of stop motion is impressive and difficult to do, but that’s about all the nice things I can say about this movie. The overall plot of this movie is more than lacking and I find myself falling asleep less than 15 minutes into the movie. Also can we talk about how annoying some of the characters are, like the three trick-or-treaters and Dr. Finkelstein. Furthermore, I’m so tired of Tim Burton movies and their never ending goth and emo vibes. And don’t even get me started on how some people try and say this is a Christmas classic. Who enjoys emo vibes during the Christmas season? If there are other sane people out there please confirm what I am saying, and if not then can the crazy people explain how they enjoy this for Christmas.",

Normally, I love a movie that tries to go portray a morally messed up character in a way that still makes you feel empathy. I love Scorsese movies for this reason.\n\nHowever, where Scorsese does not shy away from showing the moral shortcomings of his main characters, I feel Spielberg did not really seem to portray Franks behavior as wrong at all. The music makes it all feel like it is a family friendly \"Home Alone\" ordeal. As if Frank is just being a little rascall that is ultimately a good person. He really isn't though. Pretending to be a co-pilot is one thing, but pretending to be a doctor, or Marrying a girl who'se life must be entirely ruined after finding out how her husbands life is a complete lie. I feel like the movie is still portraying Frank as if he is just misunderstood, and broken about his parents divorce. \n\nI really don't get the hype this movie gets (though Leo's acting is great). I am aware that the real Frank made up vast amounts about the story, but even when you don't take that in account, it is still portrayed a little weird.\n\nNot trying to be an edgelord here. Primarily looking if I am either not alone in this opinion, or missing something essential about this movie. ",

I certainly wouldn’t call it a “great” comedy, but we really had fun with it and have watched it at least a couple of times.\n\nEdit: Stuart Saves His Family (30% & 53%) is a movie I’ve watched multiple times.

Where there are body parts and blood and honestly disgusting things a child shouldn’t see. Every time a really scary part would come on like the scene with the gym weights she would turn away and look into her chair out of fright. I was so furious about this parenting I wanted to say something regardless of if it would cause a problem but my girlfriend urged me not to. What do you think about this scenario? The parenting really pissed me off tbh. Theres detached limbs in the movie, shankings, shooting. And much worse. I don’t usually care about the way parents teaches and show there kids but when it’s right in front of you and seeing the trauma it sucks. What do you think?",

He never becomes the gun professional you would expect him to turn into from some of his other movies, he stays a relatively normal person.\n\nAlso, the movie is not about protecting the world population from a danger beyond our current imagination. It is entirely about saving those stranded passengers from the enemies on the island. This makes it very grounded.\n\nAlthough there is not a lot of action, I like what is included. The long take fight in the middle of the movie and the sniper scene near the end are enough to fully satisfy my action needs and stay true to the more realistic tone when compared to big blockbuster movies. \n\nAll in all, it's a nice entertainment product and maybe you can recommend me more movie projects like it.",

It’s probably in my top five animated movies I’d recommend to anyone.\n\nWe watched Wild Robot yesterday, and neither of us liked it at all. Why?\n\nThe story feels like an bland, boring, inconsistent mashup of old clichés. For example, there's a training montage with a pop song playing—surprised it wasn’t “Eye of the Tiger.” Or the classic “listen to your heart, not your mind” message. Meh. Or \"well you have small wing but believe in yourself, and those wise birds will help you\". Yawn.\n\nThe plot is full of WTF moments. The robot has half its parts removed by raccoons and somehow keeps functioning perfectly. Then it throws away its heart, main part, near the end and still works fine. They fight off the first ship, but then, for some unexplained reason, call another one. In the greenhouse, a duckling says, “Don’t be afraid, robots can’t hurt you,” and in the next second, battle robots start shooting at the ducks.\n\nAt the same time, the movie has a lot of dark undertones. Words like “death,” “die,” “killed,” and “kill” are repeated over and over. The animals are violent, the ducks are racist, humans have destroyed the planet, and they use military robots to protect greenhouses from ducks. Ok I get it, there's no light without the dark. But is there another movie with so many death mentions?\n\nAnd yet, this movie is universally loved—98% on Rotten Tomatoes, an 8.3 IMDB rating. I don’t get it. Maybe I’m crazy. Or maybe the world is.\n\nThe visuals are good, but that’s it.\n\n(This review was immediately removed by moderators of r/dreamworks with no comments why)",

Which comes in the form of him being John's personal house keeper. Over time after a somewhat rocky start, Losef and John eventually get to know each other as they start sharing about their past with each other. John talking about his wife starts to remind Losef of his mother, as they eventually slowly but surely build a bond that causes Losef to respect John and begin something of a redemption arc, seeing why his father respected him. They come to an understanding which leads Losef to get John a new dog and give his car back as an apology. I like to think the climax would have Losef get kidnapped by an old enemy where John and Viggo must work together to save Losef. There would be an epic final battle where John is ultimately victorious and walks off into the night with his dog, Losef, and Viggo. Viggo offers to give John back his old job, but John's silence gives Viggo his answer, and he tells John that should he ever feel like returning, he is always welcome back.",

The issue is that he tends to make male-led films but if he, finally, does write a female-led film, I guarantee she'll get the same issues as the male leads do.\n\nOppenheimer had the luxury of a real-life figure with a fascinating character, and even that film doesn't do him justice. The Joker had Heath Ledger doing a lot of improv for that incarnation to be as iconic as it is. Other than those two, I can't think of a compelling character in any of his films. ",

        "title": "Why is Blade Runner considered one of the greatest movies ever? ",
        "selftext": "Some context: I'm in my 40's, love scifi and PKD, although I have never read the short story the movie was based on. I somehow have never seen Blade Runner, it was forever on my list, so finally I watched it a couple days ago. I watched the final cut version.\n\n\nI liked the movie, I would give it a 8/10. What I'm sincerely trying to understand is why is it considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I try to give a rundown on what I think, and I would like to hear the opinions of the fans.\n\n\nI'd like to divide approach the movie from 3 angles: Presentation, story and themes.\n\n\nFirst, presentation. The movie sets, costumes, design and world building is very evocative and well made. I suspect that the authentic and detailed cyberpunk-esque world shown might be one of the big reasons of this movie's status, in which case it is an unfortunate case of the \"Seinfeld is unfunny\" phenomenon, where a once revolutionary never before seen thing becomes copied so many times that the original doesn't evoke the sense of wonder it originally did. Also, it has that special \"80's future\" aesthetic with steam wents, dark crumped places and beeping vector screens, which, alongside with some of the hairstyles, makes it feel a bit \"dated future\". Still I find it really impressive what they did here, the music, the long, quiet shots, the attention to detail for example at the apartment is phenomenal.\n\n\nNext, let's talk story. This is where I find the movie to be a bit lacking. If you cut off all the decorations (which I already praised in the paragraph above), it's a very basic film noir detective story: a rugged ex cop is going after some fugitives, meeting some rough figures and a mysterious woman in the process, ending in a confrontation that makes him question his values. Pretty basis stuff. Not bad, but nothing special. And I found that the only part with actual detective work (the snakeskin storyline) was in the end meaningless: No matter what Deckard did, the replicants were always going to meet the CEO, kill him and his boss will tell Deckard to go and check out the apartment where the final showdown takes place. The middle part of the story could essentially be skipped.\n\n\nAnd finally, the themes, A.K.A \"What is the movie really about\". I think this movie is a fascinating look into what makes us human, and how we choose to live our lives with the knowledge that one day we will die and all of our self becomes nothing. The movie uses the replicant identity to explore these themes. Sure, we are told that the replicants are artificial, but withing the context of the movie, they are pretty much human, except for some superhuman abilities which do not seem to alter their characters at all, so I'm not really paying much attention to them. Oh, and one more thing: they know why they exist, and they also know for certainty that they will die on 4 years. The philosophical side of the movie really kicks in in the last third, when Roy learns that they will die soon and there's nothing anyone can do about it. How can a human mind deal with this? How are we dealing with this day by day? He literally goes through the 5 stages of grief, ending on a deeply touching note with \"acceptance\" and the \"tears in the rain\" monologue. In the end, he was like us. But we don't know how long do we have left. Also, we cannot talk to our creator, he might not even exist. Our existence might be completely random and meaningless. Roy found solace in his \"complete\" existence in the end. Will you (or Deckard) be able to do the same?\n\n\nThis notion is underlined by the film challenging us to face our feelings regarding the human quality of the replicants, best with the (probably infamous) \"rape\" scene. Deckard forces himself on the girl, it is consensual but barely, and even that is arguable by modern sensibilities. Now, if she is just a robot, why are we feel uncomfortable watching this? We don't flinch when seeing someone using a sex toy (well, maybe, it depends), we don't wonder if it's good for the sex toy too. But we feel bad for her. So in this scene, we have unconsciously already sided with the replicants, who, in the end, just want to live. And to quote Oldboy, “Even though I'm no better than a beast, don't I have the right to live?”. First I thought this sex scene was just studio mandate, or 80's machismo with the manly men getting what he wants, but now I think it's a key piece to the puzzle.\n\n\nSo on this front, I think the movie is really a work of art. I would have preferred a LITTLE more \"tell\" to the 95% \"show\" they did, but that's just me, I tend to enjoy seeing onscreen characters having philosophical debates about these things like in Westworld. This is also something that might be affected being done in many movies, books and TV shows since, so the central theme being \"what measure is nonhuman?\" might not have the punch it did when the movie came out, sadly.\n\n\nSo, summing it all up, I would say presentation is 8/10, Story is 5/10, and the themes are 10/10. So I end up with an 8/10 movie. I'm happy I saw it, it gave me some stuff to think about while falling asleep, and it had really evocative visuals. What I'm trying to understand is, why is this considered one of the best movies of all time and has the following it does? Please tell me your perspective!\n",

        "selftext": "I know I am late on this one but being a straight male in my 30s this has never been high on my watch list but decided to give it a watch.\n\nI loves both the characters of Nate and Andy and I could completely understand the drift apart as Andy grows and changes into this dark human and pushes away her friends and her boyfriend.\n\nI felt that Nate wasn't given fair closure at the end of the movie and honestly in my opinion I'd be much happy seeing him move on with someone else as a consequence of her own actions and decisions Andy made throughout the film.\n\nI was disgusted to then look Into the movie more and to find people are siding with Andy in this narrative saying Nate is a bad boyfriend??\nWhat??\n\nUnfortunately it's unclear how long Andy and Nate were together before the changes however it's reasonable to think it was a good amount of time considering they live together and they share a social circle. So for me Nate had spent years loving this person who in a very short period of time changed in such a dark way and without real justification that he couldn't support the change. In fact he and all of the friends did what they could to try and make Andy realise just how far she had swung from herself for a job she herself didn't value. \n\nAnd not to brush over the fact that only days after loosing her love she jumped in bed with a man she hardly knew? Someone shed had less and 24 hours contact with between calls texts and their date over the course of however months when they met... \nI am sorry but this trait isn't something you just get or change into it's part of who someone is.\n\nNate acted out yes but it's understandable considering everything he was going through... \n\nSo my takeaway. \nNate deserves better than Andy and should have moved on alone after their meeting in the restaurant to tell her about the new job.",

Night Shyamalan’s most famous movies The Sixth Sense (more dark and sad to me then scary), Signs, The Village, then World War Z (not very violent or scary to me more stressful than anything), and that’s about it. My mom suggested watching It (1990) which I’m open to! Even though I hate clowns lol. Im not very good when it comes to gore and my parents prefer me not to watch anything inappropriate (unless it’s like one scene I can skip through). I’m looking for a movie that keeps me on the edge of my seat but isn’t crazy gory or inappropriate. I’m grateful for any suggestions! :)\n\nEdit: Thank you to all for your suggestions! Even to the ones who didn’t seem to read my post 😂. I think It will be a hard pass for movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining,  and The Thing (surprised how much that was suggested). I will definitely update once I watch some of these! Thank you again for all of your suggestions! ",

I actually thought the premise of the film was rather unique. The bit where his wife is questioned is where I thought they would see their picture and latch on but that never happened. Nicholas Hoult was very good. Larrys role was a bit odd, justin tells him everything but Larry does not go onto report?\n\nThe ending was the only part I was a bit disappointed with in that it is somewhat of an open ending. I would love to see a part 2 but obviously that won't happen. I also think the flashback episodes didn't add too much certainty past the first few. ",

        "selftext": "It is a tender and intimate look at the lives of young people in the 60s in Paris. The film follows two characters, male and female as they navigate love and the changing, ever turbulent landscape of life. The film explores the two of them through 15 interconnected but separate parts and every part has a monologue or introductory text on screen. These don't often talk about the film but also outside of it as well, most of them are for us the audience even when they relate to the plot.\n\nThe film is a drama about youth and their struggles to live and react and adjust in a world that is uncertain and cruel and things that are happening in such a wide scale that we have no control over them. It feels like a glimpse into that era, as if we're seeing how people must have lived, thought, loved and died in that time. This is pronounced more through the use of shots of people wandering in the streets going to and fro in between the 15 parts.The themes that are talked about here resemble the ones found in Alphaville even though genre-wise these both movies are very different. Love and it's need in human life, violence and power and using that to decide things in other people's lives, the word \"tenderness\" and it's importance in the narrative,  poetry and the attitude different characters have to it.\n\nThis was so refreshing and different and bolder than most modern movies being made today, it isn't afraid to talk about things it wants to yet there is a tenderness to it though it's less romantic than Alphaville",

Critically well received, not big in box office. Then they do small roles in big films. Well received. Then they get a main role in a cheap film that ended up doing really good. Then thy do the big budget action films that end up failing. That is the usually life cycle. If they are lucky, they can bounce back after a few small good films\n\nI have seen this trend and can recognise it. I remember it with Vin Diesel who went from an indie film to Saving Private Ryan to pitch Black then Fast and Furious and his big flop was XXX. That same year 2002, Colin Farrell started in Minority Report and Harts War that made him big. He broke through in TigerLand.He became huge the next year with The Recruit Daredevil and phone Booth. He crashed and burned the next year with Alexander and Miami Vice. That year 2004, Jude Law became huge with Alfie, Cold Mountain and other films.\n\nCan anyone else give examples of this trend?

It was the day before my birthday, and I was dealing with a lot of family stuff. This guy I was seeing at the time came over to comfort me. He suggested we watch a movie, and La La Land came up on Netflix. When he found out I’d never seen it, he insisted we put it on.\n\nI loved it, but I was so distracted by everything going on that I couldn’t fully immerse myself. Flash forward to now—months later, I was out at a bar, and they were advertising a rooftop movie night featuring La La Land. It immediately made me want to rewatch it. Living in LA, this movie already hits a little harder, and adding to that, the guy I watched it with in June is no longer in my life.\n\nWe ended our story a few weeks ago. In July, he went on a three-month solo trip that I knew about when we first started seeing each other. He messaged me a few times while he was gone, and I couldn’t help but hope we’d pick things up when he got back. I wasn’t waiting around for him, but I did reach out once he returned since I wasn’t exclusively seeing anyone. He messaged back, saying he’d love to see me, but he’s planning to leave LA and is applying to grad schools. It crushed me.\n\nWatching the movie again now, with him out of my life because he’s following his own path, I just broke down. It hit so hard to think about what could’ve been because things between us felt so good. Part of me thinks maybe one day we’ll cross paths again, and maybe we’ll both be single and find each other at the right time. But the other part of me wonders if our paths are just meant to lead us to different people.\n\nRight now, I’m struggling to accept that. But damn, this movie hits. I love it and I hate it.",

It's a South Indian (Tamil) movie from 2009, so the CGI is pretty shabby, but the actual storyline is pretty deep. It's about a smuggler named Deva working with his late dad's friend and crew. They smuggle internationally from Africa to Malaysia and have many local rivals. One of these rivals, named Kamalesh, has always strived to be the biggest in the smuggling industry but does it in immoral ways, such as ratting on the competition. How Deva works together with Law enforcement to take down Kamalesh forms the crux of the story. The story works perfectly because it's a mix of comedy, heavy action, and romance while using some pretty deep scientific knowledge throughout the film.

Quickly the trend wore on audiences, to the point that Divergent's split 3rd book did not get it's Part Two made due to Part One being a disappointment.\n\nWith these disappointments, Marvel changed their Infinity War Part One and Two, to Infinity War and Endgame. \n\nRecently Dune was marketed and sold as Dune. Only for the first moment of the film to announce it as actually Part One of a series.\n\nMission Impossible marketed it's final films as Dead Reckoning Part One, but has now switched it's Part Two to The Final Reckoning, likely due to Part One's box office disappointment\n\nEdit: I have also realised that Wicked is releasing as just Wicked, yet Wicked Part Two is expected next year\n\nEdit 2: **YOU** Mr r/movies browsing cinema nerd may have known Dune was a Part 1. However the layperson would never know, and still wouldn't know even if they were to watcht the trailer, see it's posters, and buy a ricket, or buy the BluRay even today. Even next to eachother one could safely assume Part 2 is just a sequel, and not the other half of the story.\n\nDo you think this is finally the end of movies telling us upfront that they are Parts?

We saw an airplane when he attended his parents’ funeral, so maybe there’s a deeper meaning here. Maybe there was nothing to the way the child ran on the beach with his arms extended. \n\nHowever, one scene confounds me. After Naoufel jumps to that crane, we see his hand starts retreating. I can’t understand this at all. \n\nAnother question: It’s not apparent to me that he had any guilt on his parents’ death. I know he was very upset. What evidence is there that he felt guilt? \n\nAlso, here are points that I’ve noticed, and I’d love your views as well:\n\n* Towards the end, when the hand was using an umbrella to navigate, it encounters an astronaut which gives him guidance. The astronaut points the direction for the hand to go. \n* The only time a fly was caught was when he had his hand severed. His severed hand briefly caught a fly, and then, the fly escaped. \n* When  Naoufel leaves Gigi, Gabrielle lays on his bed and explores his old personal space. Gabrielle also listens to his recording, and she smiles. This implies to me that she clearly had feelings for him, but it’s not apparent if they are romantic. \n* The instance Naoufel has feelings for Gabrielle is while he was delivering her a pizza. She asked him if he was OK. \n* Naoufel revisits the most auspicious and emotional place for him, and that’s on the rooftop by the wooden igloo. That’s where he spent a very special time with Gabrielle. He revealed his feelings of love to her basically. And that’s where he returned to reclaim his life, break free from his parents’ death, and maybe accept the loss of his hand and the loss of Gabrielle (**I’m not sure about this, however.**)\n* It’s very peculiar that even Gabrielle doesn’t live with her parents. We never knew the circumstances of her parents. \n* Naoufel meets Gabrielle, and we realize that Raof is his relative. I’m not sure if Gabrielle thought that Raof was boyfriend material. She may have found him sexy or charismatic. \n* What illness does Gigi have? Gabrielle implied that he was sick. \n* I am not familiar with the book “The World According to Garp,” but I have a feeling that there’s symbolism in that book. What do you think is the significance, if any, of this book?\n* During Naoufel‘a parents’ funeral, we see Naoufel wearing a cast. There’s a man right behind him also wearing a cast. What does this symbolize? What’s this about?",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than two weeks I'm asking you for participating on my search for the most favorite movie set in a given european country everyday. There are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is official part of the given country today. Especially, when it's hard to find a movie that entirely takes place in the given country, it's okay, when only a certain part of the story is set there - but all in all, it has to be the biggest part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nTwo days ago, especially the first rule lead to some confusion. I'm very happy that I'm able to declare ***ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი*** (engl.: *Blue Mountains*) the winner for Georgia today, but when it comes to upvotes (minus downvotes), he was really only the runner-up while the movie with the most of them was only set in Georgia for about 10 minutes, before the main protagonist took a journey to Germany. Funnily enough, Germany was the next country in my list and the yesterday, ***Das Leben der Anderen*** (engl.: *The Lives of Others*) won by a wide margin.\n\nBecause Germany is my home country, I could write much longer about it now - like how I thought a certain running Lola would win, or how disappointed I am that no one put *Werner - Beinhart* in the running - but really, it's time to move on now... to **Greece**. This time I've put the two rules right at the beginning of the post, so I'll just wish you lots of fun at this point.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "selftext": "Josef von Sternberg's screenplay is based on the novel by Michiro Maruyama, which describes the real events and was translated into English by the Korean Kang Younghill. It is about twelve Japanese sailors who are stranded on a deserted and forgotten island called Anatahan in June 1944 and spend seven years there. The only inhabitants of the island are the overseer of a former plantation and an attractive young Japanese woman. Discipline is embodied by a former petty officer, but it collapses when he suffers a disastrous loss of prestige. Soon, discipline and reason are replaced by a struggle for power and women. Power is represented by two pistols found in an American plane that crashed on the island and is so brutal that five men pay with their lives in the struggle for control.\n\nAnatahan, an island in the Mariana Islands archipelago in the tropical Pacific, was the scene of the event. Thirty Japanese sailors and soldiers and one Japanese woman were stranded here during the war. The castaways hid until they surrendered to a U.S. Navy rescue team in 1951, almost seven years after Japan’s defeat. The twenty people who survived this hell were warmly welcomed upon their return to post-war Japan. International interest, including an article in Life magazine on July 16, 1951, inspired Josef von Sternberg to adapt the story into a feature-length documentary film, the plot of which was set within the framework of the events that had become known.\n\nBy the end of 1951, shocking personal details had come to light about the deaths and disappearances of men in the rivalry over the only woman on the island, Higa Kazuko.\n\nAlthough the film features Japanese dialogue throughout, this is not translated into English - instead, we have the writer-director himself providing intermittent commentary to expound on the action! Even so, this and the ghostly parade of victims at the end constitute the only stylistic flourishes within the film.\n\nHis Marlene Dietrich films center around a mysterious woman upon whom men project their desires for sex, love, violence and revenge. Here Keiko is the final mystic Sternberg temptress. Like Concha in The devil is a woman, she watches, calmly bemused, as the men fight, kill, and die to possess her. Like all the classic Sternberg heroines, she is a free agent and a free spirit, using her sensuality to get her way at times, but never belonging to any one man any longer than she chooses.  \n",

        "selftext": "I wanted to highlight a quote from the interview, because he addresses a point I've seen other redditors make about theatrical windows being \"elitist\".\n\n“I think [studios] forget that releasing films in theaters first, it’s not an elitist thing. Everybody will eventually see the film, but what it is — putting it out there and exhibiting it the way that is the most ideal way of presenting it to audiences — it elevates the importance,” Baker said. “Number one, people have to actually schedule their night, spend money, travel to a theater. I think it ups the importance of it in our minds.”\n\nI've seen several redditors try and counter this point, and I've never seen one whose point really goes any further than \"because I don't wanna wait\" no matter how much they dress it up.  I get that you might have limitations that prevent you from enjoying or even being able to go to the theater and that it can be frustrating that you can't see something you want to see, but sorry guys that obv shouldn't come at the cost of the experience being crafted by artists.  It's not a punishment to wait a few months ffs.\n\nLook I like streaming, I grew up with it and it's convenience.  But when I was a teen I started going to the theater more and appreciating it for giving me an experience I can't match at home.  Hell can anyone match it?  Do you have anywhere between 8 and 64 cinema speakers in your home?  And that's not even touching on the whole cultural relevancy topic.  Can you imagine if longlegs went straight to streaming?  I didn't even like the movie that much and I still talk about it. (Not a movie but it's funny to me no one mentions stranger things for like 2 years, then it's all the talk for 2 weeks max, then another 2 years of nothing)\n\nHopefully theaters can continue to draw people back post covid and work on making the experience and quality better for people.  I also read AMC was planning some major renovations so it sounds like we're getting a first step.",

        "selftext": "Since April 2021, I've engaged in a personal challenge where once a week I watch one film I haven't watched before; an unseen movie. It can be a newly released film or it can be decades old; it just has to be one I haven't watched yet. I've watched plenty of films before doing this and honestly my number of total films I've watched is probably closer to 500 at least.\n\nBut anyway, sometime in December I will be watching my 200th film as part of my weekly challenge. My problem is that I want it to be a really good film to celebrate doing this for almost 200 weeks (It's probably more like 195 weeks but whatever). My 100th film was Good Will Hunting, which was probably one of the best films I watched in 2023, so I'm looking for something along the lines of that in terms of a classic movie.\n\nSo with all that in mind, what you recommend be my 200th film?\n\nI have a list of all the films I've watched as part of my challenge, which is fairly diversified.

        "selftext": "**Gladiator II - Review Thread**\n\n* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gladiator_ii): 76% (91 Reviews)\n   * **Critics Consensus**: Echoing its predecessor while upping the bloodsport and camp, Gladiator II is an action extravaganza that derives much of its strength and honor from Denzel Washington's scene-stealing performance.\n* [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gladiator-ii/): 67 (32 Reviews)\n\nReviews:\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/11/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-ridley-scotts-long-awaited-sequel-best-picture-oscar-winner-1236172181/):\n\n>*Gladiator* is a hard act to follow but Sir Ridley Scott proves still to be a master working up a Roman orgy of excitement that proves a worthy successor in every way.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-ridley-scott-1236057985/) (60):\n\n>In terms of brutal spectacle, elaborate period reconstruction and vigorous set pieces requiring complex choreography, the sequel delivers what fans of its Oscar-winning 2000 predecessor will crave — battles, swordplay, bloodshed, Ancient Roman intrigue. That said, there’s a déjà vu quality to much of the new film, a slavishness that goes beyond the caged men forced to fight for their survival, and seeps into the very bones of a drama overly beholden to the original.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-denzel-washington-pedro-pascal-ridley-scott-1236204115/) (70):\n\n>Written by David Scarpa (“Napoleon”) and directed by Scott (who, at 86, hasn’t lost his touch for the peacock pageantry of teeming masses thirsting for blood), the movie is a solid piece of neoclassical popcorn — a serviceable epic of brutal warfare, Colosseum duels featuring lavish decapitations and beasts both animal and human, along with the middlebrow “decadence” of palace intrigue.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal/) (58):\n\n>“Gladiator II” has everything it needs in the action department. The battles are certainly spectacular. It’s the story that falls apart. The whole thing hangs on contrivance and familiarity, not characters, so the fights don’t seem to matter much. Even Denzel Washington, who has all the best scenes and looks like he’s enjoying himself more than he has on screen in years, can’t save this material because the material isn’t focused on him. Macrinus is a lot more interesting than our hero. Come to think of it, so is General Acacius. They could have carried the whole movie themselves, one or the other or both. Which means the thing that’s holding “Gladiator II” back is, weirdly, the fact that it’s about a gladiator.\n\n[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/gladiator-2-review/) (80):\n\n>Not perfect and not a patch on the original film, but the magic of Ridley Scott's direction and Denzel Washington's performance elevates Gladiator 2 into the epic spectacle it needs to be. But best to manage your expectations in comparison to the Oscar-winning film.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/11/gladiator-2-review-paul-mescal-ridley-scott) (4/5):\n\n>Scott’s return to the Roman arena is something of a repeat, but it’s still a thrilling spectacle and Mescal a formidable lead. We are entertained.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/gladiator-ii-review-paul-mescal-1235064268/) (50):\n\n>Gladiator II” wouldn’t be the first sequel to become bogged down in its resemblance to its forebear, but the various superficial modifications made to characterizations and action sequences operate under faulty bigger-is-better sequel logic.\n\nDirected by Ridley Scott:\n\n>Over two decades after the events of Gladiator, Lucius—the son of Lucilla and Maximus—lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by General Marcus Acacius invade, killing his wife and forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator under the teaching of Macrinus, a former slave who plots to overthrow the young emperors Caracalla and Geta.\n\nCast:\n\n* Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus\n* Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius\n* Joseph Quinn as Emperor Geta\n* Fred Hechinger as Emperor Caracalla\n* Lior Raz as Vigo\n* Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus\n* Connie Nielsen as Lucilla\n* Denzel Washington as Macrinus",

Jason Lee is hilarious in it and the Stan Lee cameo is great.

This movie is now over 20 years old and nobody had spoiled the twist for me, I literally had no clue. All I knew about the movie was revenge, hammer scene and some twist. I tried to predict it, >!my wife thought it was going to be one of those 'he was under hypnosis all along and nothing happened' things!<but boy were we unprepared for that ending. At the end of the movie I was a bit like 'okay that just happened', and not sure what to think of it. The days after we kept discussing it and it kept being on my mind, and I guess there's a great reason for it being considered one of the best movies of all time.\n\nWe also watched Seven, after all these years. Of course we knew what was in the box because pop-culture, but that doesn't make the whole movie any less effective. I hate to say it but Kevin Spacey is so good in this movie, and knowing he's a creep kind of makes it better. I'm not sure how to feel about that. Anyway, very understandable why it's such an instant classic.\n\nWe did watch another classic to finish the weekend: The Princess Bride, which was such a nice palate cleanser. Next week... The Silence of The Lambs and Zodiac. Wish us luck",

        "selftext": "I'm pretty sure I sound really stupid right now, but I'm genuinely curious as to why directors have their own production companies. I'm much more in tune with the music industry, and generally, singers have their own labels if they want more creative freedom over what they put out and ownership of their music. They also tend to sign other artists to their label. On the other hand, artists who have significant leverage over their music but aren't interested in running a label can simply sign with a premier record label. But when I see directors' production companies, they mostly seem to produce only their own films. Is there a financial advantage for them in producing their own films? Is it about creative freedom? And most importantly, couldn't their films just be produced and financed solely by other established production companies, similar to how artists in the music industry sign with a premier record label?",

Even some of my film teachers hate Avatar and I really can't wrap my head around that. Yeah, it ain't no screenwriting marvel but come on, the movie is gorgeous and pushed filmaking to new horizons, and I think the sequel did an even better job at telling a compelling story. I can understand why you'd dislike the movie's plot and all but why be vocal about it now and not in 2009? Is it a trend or am I missing something?",

        "selftext": "I'm a fan of legendary production designer / conceptual artist Ron Cobb (1937 - 2020), who contributed to the iconic look and feel of movies such as Star Wars, Back to the Future, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Aliens, and Total Recall. One of his lesser known movies is Leviathan, which I finally got around to watching last night.\n\nIn brief: This movie is a real treasure, and I don't know why it has been so completely forgotten. Peter Weller of Robocop fame has the lead role as a geologist wrangling a motley crew of deep sea miners. When they stumble across the sunken wreck of a Russian ship that vanished in mysterious circumstances, they unwittingly bring a mutated and abhorrent life form back into their mining rig.\n\nSome stray observations and minor spoilers ahead:\n\n* Really, I watched this movie because of Ron Cobb's involvement, but was surprised to find out that special effects supremo Stan Winston was involved in creating the various creatures as well. This movie had more special effects talent than it knew what to do with.\n* The poster and promotional material make it sound a lot like The Abyss (1988). The actual plot is much more like Alien (1979), with a little of The Thing (1984) sprinkled in.\n* Ernie Hudson is immensely likeable as a workaday grunt. He really bulked up for this role, and I'm surprised that he never broke into the action movie A-list like Wesley Snipes or Danny Glover.\n* Amanda Pays steals the show as a competent and capable cadette on her way to astronaut school. It's astonishing that her career never came to anything after this. This girl could act.\n* It's odd to watch a movie as goofy as this where the adults still act like adults. They resolve conflicts at work by reading the rules and regulations to each other, kind of like how real adults resolve conflicts at work. In the superhero dominated world of today, they would be punching each other.\n* Most movies these days feel about 30 minutes too long for the material they have. This one feels 30 minutes too short. They build an interesting world with compelling characters in a long first act, and then rush the rest. A lot about the creature they are fighting is left frustratingly vague.\n* Meg Foster is on wonderful form as a coldhearted corporate executive. She's Reaganomics distilled into one woman. I remember her playing a similar role in They Live (1987). What a thing to be typecast as.\n\nOverall, a solid 7/10 for me, and well worth a tight 98 minutes of your time.",

        "selftext": "I know the creators of John Wick have listed a bunch of inspiration but I watched Equilibrium (2002) for the first time yesterday and one scene is super John Wick coded. Christian Bale is hiding a puppy in his trunk and he gets discovered by an enforcement team while he’s trying to drive the puppy out of town. The puppy gets discovered with a lil tiny woof and Christian Bale then goes on to kill all the people on the enforcement team who would have killed the puppy. \n\nMy first thought was that it seems like somebody could have seen that scene, though “this, but it’s the whole movie” and made John Wick.",

        "selftext": "Alright people, remember in 87 when Filmation made a pseudo disney sequel called Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night?? The movie stars lots of famous people like James Earl Jones, Ed Asner, Frank Welker, and Rickie Lee Jones. The movie takes place a year after Pinocchio turns into a human, crazy. Scott Grimes from American Dad was Pinocchio... Gosh like why didn't American Dad reference this movie?? I also heard that it's got nightmare fuel elements as well. Like people have said that Pinocchio turning back into a puppet scared them as kids, like did Scott Grimes know that this was going to be terrifying, like geez Scott ask Lou if it was going to be... I wonder if the people making this got inspiration from **Return to Oz** because maybe of the heads in glass cases scene and because of the scary imagery as well. Also because of sticking to the books, maybe...\n\nFirst off if Pinocchio is only like a year old, how does he have the ability to walk and talk, did the blue fairy give him the power to do so?? If Pinocchio was like only one year old, then he'd probably babble a lot and he'd have to learn to walk, Pinocchio would probably fall down a lot if he had to deliver that jewel box to the Mayer.  Did the emperor give Pinocchio the power to turn into a real boy or maybe his body is special...\n\nSecond why was Pinocchio in the sudden urge to have fun when entering the Neon Cabaret he was looking for the jewel box??\n\nDid the crew/animators of this movie also stick to the original source material like the original Pinocchio story besides the Disney one?? I learnt from the 1911 Pinocchio there was a Land of Toys place, which the Land Where Dreams Come True had it\n\nProbably in the year prior, the blue fairy found Pinocchio as a puppet sitting on the counter and the fairy godmother turned him to a real boy. \n\nBut the most popular question that got people wondering for years was, \"Was Twinkle an actual girl that got turned into a puppet??\" because of her ability to sing as a puppet. Poor Twinkle, I'm pretty sure she must've wanted a friend\n\nPretty sure he'd need Geppetto to hold his hand for going places cause that's very dangerous for someone like him to do. Pinocchio sure didn't know about the dangers of going off with strangers\n\nConsidering this was based of Carlo Collodi's story, It would've made sense for there to be picture books to go with the film haha\n\nThis Pinocchio adaptation was kind of also known for ripping off the Disney version\n\nGosh I kind of wish to see more behind the scenes making of this movie, like pics of the actors working on the movie.. \n\nCome on people, This time I need comments here ",

[Part 1 here](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gnhk55/as_a_horror_movie_connoisseur_heres_my_ultimate/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Late Night With the Devil (2023)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 9.7\n\nCommentary: This is part 2 so we are coming out swinging. Bring your friends/lover, grab a beer and behold the ultimate late night talk show horror movie, this shit is a certified banger.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Mist (2007)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 9.3\n\nCommentary: Lovecraft, tentacles, stuck in place, fog. Fucking A+ movie. Best served with an authentic super burrito and coke zero.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Deadstream (2022)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 8\n\nCommentary: Obnoxious livestreamer goes to a haunted house alone and shit happens. Put on your PJ's and grab some salty popcorn.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Dark and The Wicked (2020)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 8\n\nCommentary: If you liked When Evil Lurks you will like this bad boy grab yourself a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoy the evil slow burn.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A Dark Song (2016)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 7.5\n\nCommentary: This movie deals in the occult dark magic. This is an intensely dark movie therefore Steak and Red Wine is the recommendation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Dark Skies (2013)**\n\nSpawn's Score 7.5\n\nCommentary: What if the things that are not of this world were fucking scary? An intense film that escalates and escalates until it culminates into a satisfactory climax. Popcorn of the buttery variety, don't forget the coke zero.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Blair Witch Project (1999)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 7.6\n\nCommentary: Considered by many the Godfather of found footage films, grab some buttery popcorn and watch these fucking fools running around a forest while weird creepy shit happens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County (1998)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 5.5\n\nCommentary: Did you think the Blair Witch Project invented found footage? Wrong! This shit right here was released a whole year earlier! It's about what's in the fucking title, it probably had fucking garbage budget, watch these fools freak out over a laser pointer it's awesome. Best served with salted diced tomatoes, salami and chardonnay. Pro-tip: AKA The McPherson tape this shit is available for free on youtube.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n\n**The Substance (2024)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 8\n\nCommentary: Hopefully not a controversial take but have you ever wondered what goes in the mind of your favorite celebrities when they do plastic surgery and end up looking worse than before? Make yourself a ham and cheese grilled sandwich and watch this shit, it's fucking wild.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hell House LLC (2015)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 7.2\n\nCommentary: Do you like halloween IRL haunted houses? Do you wanna see some freaky found footage shit that is actually fairly well done? Get that chicken cesar salad done and check this shit out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**IT (2017)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 10\n\nCommentary: King's fucking murderous clowns. A modern classic of horror films. Has Stranger Things vibes for obvious reasons so if you like that you will love this. Thin pepperoni pizza and watch it in 4k.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Shining (1980)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 9\n\nCommentary: Truthfully I've always liked the one no one talks about as a kid. But as a less regarded adult pretender I now understand my misguided ways, hot chocolate on a particularly cold night.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Evil Dead (2013)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 8.7\n\nCommentary: The remake of a classic that actually is good. This shit is fun, it's action packed. It's also fucking disgusting, in fact legend says this movie had the most fucking blood out of all movies ever. Do you like blood with your horror movies? Then you like this shit. Enjoy with fish and chips plus hazy IPA beer, don't forget the tartar sauce.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Descent (2005)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 7.5\n\nCommentary: Like Hereditary, this a reddit favorite thru and thru. Grab yourself a few tacos, make a Mojito and watch these cave hiking women get stuck in a fucking cave with creepy scary shit inside.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**V/H/S and V/H/S2 (2012 and 2013)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 6 and 7\n\nCommentary: Bunch of unrelated short horror segments are played over an overarching \"story\". The first 2 V/H/S has some of the best segments but later V/H/S movies also have some good shit. Standout segment: Safe Haven from V/H/S2. If you could only watch one of the segments this would be the one, fucking creepy cultists are interviewed and shit gets wild(the very ending is fucking hilarious though). Salty popcorn for this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 8.5\n\nCommentary: A classic not only of horror but of movies in general. The birth of a cultural icon. Put on your PJ's, grab some hot chocolate and enjoy on a rainy night right before bed or in bed. Sweet dreams.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Fog (1980)**\n\nSpawn's Score: 8.3\n\nCommentary: Can't have The Mist in the list and not have The Fog. Did you like The Mist? Do you like creepy fog and the unnatural? Then you will like this shit. Best enjoyed with ice cold Sauvignon Blanc, salami and diced heart of palm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the wondrous universe of horror movies, hidden within lie countless gems of which we shall slowly uncover. If you haven't seen a movie you were expecting to be in here yet, it may well be in part 3 in a couple of days.",

Especially the question which geographic territory was part of which country at which time lead to some confusion here. Because of that, I'm not able to prononunce the winner at this point, because I really have to be clear: Does ***ჯარისკაცის მამა*** (engl.: *A father of a soldier*) really take place in Georgia for most of the time or not? Stay tuned. \n\nUntil I found out more about this special case, we go to another country, that also plays its role in the aforementioned movie: I am looking for your favorite movie set in **Germany**. Today it's a bit more personal for me, because I'm sitting right there, in Germany, and of course I know a few movies that are set here. I would even bet my money on one in particular, but that would have already cost me money with France. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but in my eyes, it has to be the largest part. \n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes). For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!",

        "selftext": "Regarding the discussion earlier about how Thora Birch's career floundering was in no small part due to her father's antics, it's a burden of child actors that in addition to all the other pitfalls of the profession, having to deal with that type of parent is especially difficult. Kit Culkin is maybe the most infamous example of recent decades (give credit to his sons for being able to escape and keep working, especially Kiernan with \"Succession), but one I especially feel bad for is Will Wheaton. Want to know how he did so well as the neglected Gordie in \"Stand by Me?\" Because he drew from experience as his actual parents were WORSE. Big example; he did the cheesy horror flick \"The Curse\" the next year because his parents wanted the bigger payday and because his sister could be cast as well. And not only did the film fail and do considerable damage to his career, but he and his sister frequently had to work 12 hour days in violation of child labor laws and in frequently hazardous conditions and that big payday was largely spent by the parents on themselves. Is it any wonder Wheaton's considered his \"Star Trek\" cast mates more family than his actual parents? \n\nOne more amusing example, however, is from the 1988 \"The Blob\", where young Douglas Emerson (later the ill-fated Scott on \"90210\") had an overbearing stage mom who kept pestering director Chuck Russell to give him more screentime. This may be a factor as to why Emerson's character gets such an ugly demise near the climax.",

        "title": "Binoche and Fiennes Talk Pasolini’s New Odyssey-Inspired Movie",
        "selftext": "“The English patient” and “Wuthering Heights” co-stars Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes meet again as another iconic on-screen couple, this time incarnating Odysseus and Penelope in Uberto Pasolini’s new movie, “The Return”, described as an out-of-the-box re-telling of the last rhapsody of Homer’s epic, The Odyssey.\n\n\n\nFollowing a world first at Toronto in September, the movie had its Greek premiere at Thessaloniki International Film Festival on Saturday, in the presence of the director and the lead actors, who answered questions during a press conference moderated by the Festival’s head of programming, Yorgos Krassakopoulos.\n\n\n\nThe previous day, Binoche and Fiennes had received honorary Golden Alexander awards for being “not just great actors, but also two courageous explorers of human feelings, pioneers of their art, genuine narrators of unique stories,” as explained by the Festival’s Artistic Director, Orestis Andreadakis.\n\n\n\nWork in progress for thirty years\n\n“The Return” director Uberto Pasolini disclosed that he had been thinking about making a movie on the Odyssey for thirty years until he finally approached the starring duo with a proposal.\n\n\n\n“That is to say, 10 years longer than it took Odysseus to battle in Troy, to embark on his return, to engage in love affairs with the Mediterranean’s most beautiful women, to kill 108 suitors, at least according to Homer, and at last, end up within Penelope’s arms. In our film we had to murder far fewer men, I’d like for that to be noted,” the director joked.\n\n\n\n“When I was invited to join Odysseus’s “dance,” I went along. It was all very beautiful: the writing, the dialogues and, of course, the idea of working with Ralph again,” Binoche commented.\n\n\n\nFiennes pointed out that the movie script held no surprises, as the Odyssey was a story he had known since he was a child, but he had to understand the director’s version which focused on the hero’s inner struggle.\n\n\n\n“Uberto has managed to imbue his characters with psychological depth, offering us a beautiful challenge,” the acclaimed actor said.\n\n  \nFilming in Greece for Pasolini’s Odyssey movie\n\nFilming for “The Return” took place primarily on Corfu and in the Peloponnese, aided by Greek co-producer Kostantinos Kontovrakis, who found it “incredibly important for a Greek producer to have the opportunity to make a movie based on the Odyssey epic, and to preserve the values keeping it relevant and timely.”\n\n\n\nWorking with Pasolini, Fiennes and Binoche was “a dream come true” for him.\n\n\n\nFor the leading duo, it was very important to visit the Greek locations before filming, in order to get to know the people and familiarize with the process.\n\n\n\n“I’ve been to Ithaca twice, it is a place that exudes such a powerful energy,” said Fiennes. The actor has traveled extensively in Greece, especially in the Peloponnese.\n\n\n\n“I find your country exceptional. There is a tremendous energy that I can identify with, which you can find on the islands, in its seas and landscapes, in its topography and mountains. Powerful spirits dwell over there. I experience a similar feeling on the west coast of Ireland,” Fiennes shared.\n\n\n\nThe acclaimed actor saw “The Return” as a profound experience. In his own words, “some roles are literally impossible to describe.”\n\n\n\nOdysseus’ inner struggle put on screen\n\n“The Return” has been from the start the story of a family reunion, according to Pasolini.\n\n\n\n“Most of all, it is an odyssey of the mind and spirit, not a literal journey. This is the real inner struggle of Odysseus, and as the script evolved, more emphasis was placed on the inner conflicts and problems of the family. We focused more on the people rather than the myths,” he stated.\n\n\n\nFiennes describes his role of Odysseus as a man who painstakingly arrives home after much suffering, unsure if he can stay: “A man who is mentally shattered by all the hardships of the journey, an inner journey that goes through Penelope, with whom he is at a tragic impasse, as they are unable to reconnect after all they have been through.”\n\n\n\n“All of us, in one way or another, are seeking our very own personal Ithaca. Odyssey speaks to us all about the struggle to return. We are all on a journey and return is the question we carry within us,” he reflected on the deeper meaning of the movie.\n\n\n\nFor Binoche, the long-awaited return to Ithaca is irrespective of the form it may take or the meaning it may hold for each person. To her, teaming up with Ralph Fiennes – in what she believes, judging by age, could consist their last film together – and having been able to turn Uberto Pasolini’s vision into reality, was landing up at a personal Ithaca.\n\n\n\nHomeric Penelope’s similarities to a modern woman\n\nDespite the fact that The Odyssey was written more than 2,600 years ago, its most iconic female character, Penelope, a universal symbol of spousal love and fidelity, draws more similarities to a modern woman than one would imagine.\n\n\n\nFor Juliette Binoche, Penelope’s greatest challenge was maintaining her mental health.\n\n\n\n“Penelope faces a nightmare day in and day out, pretending that everything is fine. She is much more complicated than a woman who is just awaiting her husband’s return. She must employ a cunning way to deal with the dark side of humanity. You never confront the devil face to face, but sideways. And thus, she manages to deal with a situation that would otherwise destroy her,” she observes.\n\n\n\nAnswering what her role as Penelope adds to the image of the modern woman, Binoche said that is “a deeply personal matter,” which resonates with different kinds of women, in a variety of ways.\n\n  \n“Penelope, even as an archetype, is a very modern woman. She embarks on her own journey and comes face to face with what it means to have faith. The patience required of this woman is immense,” the French star commented.\n\n\n\n“If we try to form parallels between the story and today’s standards, we would say it is an attempt of coordinating and bringing together our feminine and masculine sides, but also an attempt to return to the essence, to the heart of ourselves, to home. As such, although a classic work, it remains more contemporary than ever,” Binoche stressed.\n\n\n\nOdyssey’s multiple interpretations reflected in movie\n\nPasolini added to Binoche’s remarks on her heroine that Homer’s works are open to multiple interpretations, and, from a feminist standpoint, there are two ways to interpret it.\n\n\n\n“The first is that Penelope is a woman submissive in nature, while the second, which makes more sense to me, is that Penelope is a woman who makes her choices. Penelope is in charge of what is going on in the island. She has the power to make decisions, she changes the course of events, she is a woman fully capable of taking on responsibilities,” the director believes.\n\n\n\nOn the subject of distractions in Odysseus’ journey, Pasolini argued that for the hero, the main internal struggle has to do with violence: “Although a man who avoids and abhors violence, Odysseus eventually confronts the obligation to turn to it”.\n\n\n\nOn Fiennes’ opinion, “it’s a terrible violation of his humanity, hiding within it a relentless question: when is it okay to utilize violence in order to get what you want?”\n\n\n\n“By the finale, we all want him to get his house back from the suitors, who are the representation of the malevolent forces trying to grasp something that doesn’t belong to them. Odysseus knows he must resort to violence. I often return to the text of the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna speaks to the warrior prince Arjuna about his sacred duty to fight. Our destiny and our destination are always greater than the small battles that scare us. I believe that Odysseus too must enter this zone of violence to complete his sacred duty,” the on-screen Odysseus concluded.\n\n  \n[about the movie](https://greekreporter.com/2024/11/05/juliette-binoche-ralph-fiennes-new-odyssey-inspired-movie-thessaloniki/)",

        "selftext": "After watching all three of his films, I can now safely say that Zahler is one of my absolute favorite filmmakers working today. His movies have such a visceral, intense quality that’s impossible to shake off. They’re ultra slow-paced, but in the best way possible, adding to the tension and making them incredibly nerve-racking. When the violence finally arrives, it really hits you, and no one writes dialogue quite like he does.\n\nThe last hour of Concrete is one of the most thrilling things I’ve seen in film in quite some time. Once Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn start following the van, the movie turns into a nonstop action thriller scene that stretches out the suspense as long as possible.\n\nI also want to add that, while I agree it’s clear Zahler isn’t particularly left-leaning, I strongly disagree with the idea that he’s an “ultra right-winger” making films for white supremacists. Not for a moment do I feel that his movies endorse the actions of his characters or reflect Zahler’s personal beliefs. The ideals of the characters and those of the writer can be entirely separate.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not suggesting Zahler is a Marxist, but I’ve heard him say more than once that his art isn’t politically driven, and I believe that. I always feel he’s honestly exploring the harsh worlds he portrays, not justifying anything.\n\nAnyway, I would love to discuss the movie and the rest of his work with others that are also interested in him.",

        "selftext": "**Sorry this is just something which i wanted to share based on personal opinions.**\n\nHorror movies tend to be very lucrative investment because of their low budgets and they are not expected to be a blockbuster but somehow that low budget production value adds some type of aesthetic to it just like the OG Texas Chainsaw Massacre did in the 70s.\n\nI'm from India and in 1980s India, cinema faced a downturn as low-budget B-movies, especially horror films, began outperforming mainstream Bollywood. This trend emerged as the spread of VHS drew wealthier audiences away from theaters, and mainstream films grew stale with repetitive plots. B-horror movies, however, tapped into new audiences—primarily lower-income and blue-collar workers—by incorporating voyeuristic scenes of actresses bathing and changing clothes and their scantily clad bodies, adding a softcore element that made these films popular among rickshaw drivers, laborers, and informal workers. Filmmakers would often use the same location to shoot scenes for 5-6 different movies within a single production period. These movies made a huge profits for their producers made on a budget of just 2000-3000 $.\n\nSex always has been the best way to market these cheap horror movies which cannot have enough budgets for good prosthetic or CGI effects and that trend has seen a general downturn now a days but in movies of those times, b\\*\\*bies were just thrown on the audience face time to time to get them invested in the movies.",

This is definitely a great movie to start off the early 2000’s of cinema.  \nI love the movie was shot on film, which in these days with the over-usage of digital, is our generations “Technicolor”. This movie is very much Hollywood. Gorilla-filmmaking this is not! I can picture a film-crew of 50+ in the background, with air conditioning and a full-on staffed kitchen on that island.   \nI love that the movie was temporarily halted so Tom Hanks could loss the weight, and even move love that Zemeckis would take that time to make What Lies Beneath, which in my opinion does not get the love and respect it deserves today. More so, how different both movies are.   \nIf anything, this movie does feel like 20+ screenwriters all taking a stab at the screenplay, whereas it does not feel like a singular vision, but like a child born of a whorehouse, it’s a son of a hundred fathers.   \nI would also say that the time jump does feel a little weak, but this is a Hollywood movie and not some art-house fair that would be regulated to the Criterion Channel.  \nIf there ever was a remake, I would recommend making something where we see the main character slowly lose his weight, grow his hair out, and become more “stir-crazy”.  But that would be more of a limited series, and would that work?   \nLooking at Zemeckis’s current work, I feel there is no love anymore, and is probably fat off the land. This man gave us some of the best American cinema of all time, so I won’t shit on him anymore.   \nAnyways is Castaway the last great movie of this filmmaker? Do you believe there is more blood in that stone for greatness, or should be just pat him on the back and say well done? ",

My favs would be [Playground Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFuu5wPFv1M) or [Highschool Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXFEVqi4iPE), [Ce matin-là](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRoBfcPxJdA) and [Empty House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCRo8RLZ8dA) at the end.. \n\n   * Sofia actually met her future and current husband Thomas Mars on set as he was the vocalist for Playground Love :) \n* The ending itself was such a sucker punch too, we knew it was coming and still it hit so hard. \n\n* [Leslie Hayman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371353/) who plays Therese Lisbon (stunning btw) seems to have not pursued acting after The Virgin Suicides. Her sister [Stephanie Hayman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371364/?ref_=tt_ov_wr_1) seems to have co-written a 14 minute short with Sofia Coppola, I assume that's how Leslie was connected to Sofia. The same goes for the boys in [Lee Kagan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0434574/) and [Noah Shebib(40)](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790520/) who is a record producer now.  [Anthony DeSimone](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221254/) also has not had any major roles after this movie it seems.\n* The film is based on the book by Jeffrey Eugenides but the script was written solely for the movie. Although the movie is not based on true stories, it was inspired by a girl who was babysitting Jeffrey's nephew and claimed [\"that she and her sisters had all attempted suicide\"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/11/jeffrey-eugenides-virgin-suicides-kirsten-dunce-sofia-coppola).  \n\nI just can't get over how a fictional story felt so real it was like a living dream.. from the presentation of the girls that still haunts me but is just so beautiful, the scene where the boys read Cecilia's diary (when Ce matin-là plays) to the dance scene and the girls' eventual demise. I haven't been hooked by a movie like this in a long time and consider this my love letter to The Virgin Suicides. I will definitely rewatch this movie some time soon and I'm looking forward to watching Sofia's other works, I've already watched Somewhere and Lost In Translation so far :) \n\nP.S. I also had a question about the cast, who plays Diana Porter in the movie? She seems really familiar but I don't know. Couldn't find it in the credits too. \n\n\n\n ",

The puppets are represented like this, the puppets are part of the doc’s personality traits; (it’s not in order) 9= Curiosity, 2= Innovation, 7= Bravery, (I’m still trying figure out if 1 or 8 are his guilt but I think one might lean more to his leadership and 8 his guilt)\n     I want to see/hear your thoughts about the movie since I’ve never met someone who knows about it and I thought here would be the best place.",

I feel like we (or at least *i*) need a prequel haha. Just started thinking about this because i saw that they’re making another Scary Movie which is SO COOL! can’t wait for that. but pls lmk if i’m the only one that wants another white chicks; i feel like the Wayans’ can make it amazing, they have a talent with production and delivery of lines.
