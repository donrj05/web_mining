His storytelling often operates on the edge of surrealism but is always deeply rooted in psychological realism, to the point where almost everything feels intimate and grounded.\n\nPerfect Blue for me is a movie where all of this is in full swing, and I was wondering if there are other animated movies that at least do a good job at portraying similar human internal conflicts.\n\nExtra points if it‚Äôs atmospheric, a crime based/police thriller, or delves into some horror elements as well.\n\nThere are other movies I have seen that I would offer as a reference and also recommend, to set the tone :\n\n‚óèPet Shop of¬†Horrors\n\n‚óèBelladona of Sadness\n\n‚óèMetropolis\n\n‚óèKite\n\n‚óèPaprika & Millenium Actress (Of course)\n\n‚óèThe sky crawlers \n\n‚óèWicked City",

They take it very seriously.\n\nIn the Outfit, the tailor can be seen creating suits and explaining his process and the requirements of his craft (in voiceover).  \nIn the Taste of Things, the chef is at some point cooking a complex menu and you can see him working hard on a specific dish to make it perfect. What I like also is that most of the movie are \"silent\" cooking scenes where you can see that the actors had to train, they can't totally fake it.\n\nThere is also the first scene after the intro in the first episode of The Day of The Jackal (2024) where you can see the main character at the window, preparing to kill his next target then getting away with a very methodical and serious approach.\n\nI'm looking for movies (i accept series, shows,...) that would align with these movies : an introvert/loner main character that excels at a specific craft and we get to see them perform that craft in a detailed way and its part of the main plot so that these scenes are not just anecdotal. A hitman preparing to get their next targets, a cook in the kitchen, a craftsman in their workshop,...\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions.\n\nEDIT : to be clearer, the loner aspect is a plus, but the main focus of the movie should be on the main character doing their thing (hitman, painter, chef,...) and being very good at it, to an obsessive and passionate level. It shouldn't be a background for a love story, a revenge story,...their craft should be most of the movie. For example, that first scene after the intro in the Day of the Jackal (2024 show), if it were an entire movie, that would be exactly what i'm looking for. Thank you",

Idk i suppose it just helps me come to terms with my situation and that it's a relatively common experience. \n\nRecently watched 500 Days of Summer and it destroyed me. Tonight I watched Blue Valentine and oh man. That one was even more painful to watch. If anyone has any movies of a similar vein that would be awesome. \n\nI know I sound like a downer now but I'm just trying to lean into what I'm feeling. Please hit me with some suggestions.

Some info on their interests/preferences is below!\n\n\nAll \"major\"/newer Disney/Pixar films have been watched\n\nThey're not fans of horror/scary genre content\n\nGore and sexual situations preferably kept to minimum for 13 year old, swearing is fine\n\nThey both enjoy anime - dub/English preferred over subbed\n\nRuntime 2 hours or less is preferred (for me, honestly lol)\n\n19year old likes action, mechs/Gundams, JoJos Bizarre Adventure, dark/action anime, and otherwise standard \"boy\" stuff excluding sports (with the exception of fencing)\n\n13 year old likes \"weird\" stuff (think Amazing Digital Circus), \"cute\" stuff (think Wild Robot), animals, robots, light action (loses interest during extended action sequences)\n\nNeither really care for romance but will tolerate it",

Doesn't have to be the same genre, just want that enthralling feeling with the incredible creativity and technical quality of those two movies. For instance, the John Wick series scratches the same itch for me despite a completely different setting, genre, and very few sword fights in comparison.\n\nOnly caveat I'll put in is that what I'm looking for is not as much gun-fu type stuff, which includes great Westerns like Leone's works. John Wick and whatnot do have gunplay, but the action is so varied and the hand to hand combat is so extraordinary, that it's not a dominating feature. But John Woo flicks, though, do pretty much hinge just on gunplay when it comes to their action",

That said, I have a very particular tingle, that most horrors fail to scratch. Any recommendations will be greatly appreciated.\n\nMy ideal of a story is a low budget movie called \"A Dark Song\".  \n\\- has occult stuff  \n\\- magics come with a price  \n\\- you don't know if it works or everyone is just crazy up until the end  \n\\- slow burner.\n\nI generally love the trope of a \"world behind a world\". Like most of what Clive Barker writing was. Most of what The World of Darkness RPG games tried to portray. There's a hidden reality and some humans have keys to unlock, watch, enter, explore this reality. But it comes with a price of course...\n\nThe horror element comes with the main character breaking out of their mould and expanding into this new truth for better or worse. Knowledge coming with a price is what I'm after. Also people trapped in pocked universes / loops etc.\n\nOther horror things I loved:\n\n* In the Mouth of Madness\n* As above, so below\n* Void\n* Event Horizon\n* Colour out of Space\n* Pandorum\n* Whole of The Conjuring saga, including Nun spin offs.\n* Keanu Reeves \"Constantine\" (ok not exactly a horror but still).\n* Hellraiser 5 (absolutely loved the story arc)\n* The Wishmaster series.\n* The Keep (1983 - Michael Mann, based on Wilson's novel)\n* Lovecraftian (series)\n\nIf you see a lot of Lovecraft's influence, you're right, but I never was a fan of his \"theres a cosmic horror outside reality and it melts your brain\" kind of story. It was more about \"dude finds secret knowledge\" kind of thing, if it makes any sense.\n\nIf you could add any titles that I could explore that go along the above I would be forever grateful.\n\nThanks in advance.",

The disturbing and gritty atmosphere it has is exactly what I want in my cyberpunk experience, but I've found that most movies or films simply fall flat when it comes to recreating that level of dread.\n\n What I'm really looking for is any movie or film suggestions that are both cyberpunk, and horror/thriller. Or at least something that feels more visceral than just \"corporation big and bad, cool cyberware technology on the side\". \n\n I've seen both Blade Runner movies and loved both of them. I've watched Dredd, and Robocop. All good movies. Anything along those lines or better would be great!",

The Witch and Possession are easily the two which most exemplify this. So if any good recs I'll be glad to take them! Any language or time period is fine for me i dont mind subtitles or grainy film.

Specifically, I‚Äôm interested in a film with a male lead character who‚Äôs experiencing this kind of crisis. Here‚Äôs the kind of character I have in mind:\n\nSomeone who realizes he will never become the person he imagined as his younger self. He‚Äôs confronted with reality, feeling disillusioned, as the possibility of mediocrity is no longer just a fear but seems more like an inevitable truth each passing day. He feels he will never have as much money as he hoped, never attract a truly compatible partner, never do something like a backflip, never own his dream house, never go on a lavish world tour, and never be the best at anything. He‚Äôll never be handsome or desired by young women. He‚Äôs not an utter failure but painfully mediocre‚Äîno longer with any chance of standing out. He regrets past decisions and wishes he could go back in time.\n\n*‚ÄúAbout Schmidt‚Äù* is the closest match I‚Äôve found so far. *American Beauty* also touches on a mid-life crisis and does contain some elements I‚Äôm looking for, but it only partially fits the criteria, with the focus more on an older man‚Äôs attraction to a younger girl.",

Assuming old-fashioned roles here for simplicity's sake: Maybe a male lead having that feeling of \"She's the one. I don't ever want to lose her. And I want to tell the whole world.\" Or one that illustrates what marriage means to the kind of women who want to get married - how the proposal can feel like getting chosen above everyone else, a symbol of their value to their partner and being irreplacable, reinforcing the commitment in the view of the outside world, the meaning of a more measurable commitment, the intent to take care of each other. Something that shows how for some people it can be different emotionally from other commited relationships.\n\nRom coms that end in marriage because \"that's just what you do/because the viewers expect it\" aren't quite it. \n\nSo far the first one I can think of is Price and Prejudice, but the historical context and the different meaning of marriage at the time might not translate well to the present.",

It's a South Indian (Tamil) movie from 2009, so the CGI is pretty shabby, but the actual storyline is pretty deep. It's about a smuggler named Deva working with his late dad's friend and crew. They smuggle internationally from Africa to Malaysia and have many local rivals. One of these rivals, named Kamalesh, has always strived to be the biggest in the smuggling industry but does it in immoral ways, such as ratting on the competition. How Deva works together with Law enforcement to take down Kamalesh forms the crux of the story. The story works perfectly because it's a mix of comedy, heavy action, and romance while using some pretty deep scientific knowledge throughout the film. You can watch it with English subtitles on Amazon Prime or Apple TV with a 7-day free trial but if you don't want to do that, you can create a free account and watch with English subtitles on einthusan.",

Everything feels like a very obvious cash grab... because it is.\n\nSo, please recommend me any good modern movies if you know any. Independent/indie cinema is great. Actually, older movies are great too. My favourite movies have been: Donnie Darko, mean girls, heathers, rocky horror, but I'm a cheerleader, ferris bueller's day off, back to the future, Jennifer's body, coraline, nightmare before Christmas, Paranorman, beetlejuice (the original, the reboot was awful),  corpse bride, Pleasantville, series of unfortunate events, Stardust, over the garden wall\n\nNote: before I get the \"you are only looking at the good old movies\" comment. We are oversaturated with garbage now (last good movie I saw was bottoms, that was so funny, but nothing else lately which sucks and I loved the umbrella academy). It's not that there are no movies at all that are decent, you just have to filter through so so so much more trash to get to them now. Because most companies are securing profit by using big names rather than original and creative ideas and well executed cinematography. So we're just getting a higher quantity of trash.",

Plus I'm just a fan for that retro and grainy vibe that movie cameras used to give off back then. \n\nI'm also open to suggestions for holiday episodes from TV shows as well! ",

I think it is because I am seeing somebody or something suffering more than me and therefore it makes me feel good. I apologize for this as I know it is not right.\n\nOne kind of genre, for some odd reason, that really pulls me up every time are psychological horror, supernatural films - especially of those with a religious undertone like the Nun, Conjuring, Da Vinci Code etc. I only watch gore stuff on occasions - especially around Halloween time.\n\nAlthough I adore Christmas themed films, I don't watch it enough. Christmas season to me had always been traumatic and painful and it is strange that I yearn for the perfect Christmas.\n\nI'd imagine comedy genre to be a good choice for my mental illness but I don't know many good comedy films.\n\nSci-Fi is probably one of the only genre's I know alot about as it offers escapism from my reality. I am always open to more Sci-Fi /+ Adventure recommendations!\n\nThank you all for reading this and maybe someone out there has a nice list of films they feel they can recommend to me and my situation.",

Basically movies you felt have a more unique, immersive structure - either narrative, or they follow a very specific aesthetic, or they just remind you a certain game (mention which if that's the case!). Some examples I have - \"Gonjiam Haunted Asylum\" - a found footage horror film: very immersive due to it being filmed on the characters' GoPros and on shaky, handheld cameras. The Saw franchise - aesthetic and colours are similar to 2000s horror games, the narrative structure is very unique, the set ups of the traps make it feel like you're going through it. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World - very unusual storytelling, a lot of integrated animation pieces and title cards that break the 4th wall. Would love to hear what you guys have to say!",

Petersen and the production team created an epic feel, capturing the scale of the Trojan War with grand set pieces, sweeping battle scenes, and a stunning recreation of ancient Troy.\n\nFrom a narrative perspective, Troy takes a more humanistic approach to its characters, giving depth to figures like Achilles, Hector, and Priam.\n\nHowever, as an experienced viewer of historical cinema, it‚Äôs impossible not to notice how Troy sacrifices key elements of the original myth for accessibility. Divine intervention, a crucial aspect of The Iliad, is almost entirely omitted, stripping the story of its mystical and fatalistic themes. By focusing solely on human actions, the film becomes more relatable but loses some of the myth‚Äôs depth. \n\nIn sum, Troy is a well-crafted, entertaining epic that plays to Hollywood's strengths, even if it leaves classical purists wanting more.",

The thing is, whenever I watch action movies from the era, especially ones involving swordplay and weaponry, the action is always super cheesy and impossible to buy into. It'd be fine if it were just great stunts and whatnot but to some degree you can see the strikes being slowed down, wonky editing/camerawork/angles, etc. Even Enter the Dragon, which I do enjoy in spite of them, is plagued by these issues. This was even a problem up until maybe like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon tbh (those with more astute eyes than me probably think that movie had similar issues but I was blown away by its action scenes). Being that A Touch of Zen is from the 70s, I was wondering whether it's worth watching if super cheesy action kinda takes me out of Wuxia and martial arts movies from that era?",

        "selftext": "Hey r/moviesuggestions!\n\nI‚Äôm in my twenties, and I‚Äôm really interested in exploring more young adult foreign films. I love stories that focus on themes like coming of age, romance, identity, and the challenges of growing up. I‚Äôm particularly looking for films from outside the U.S.‚ÄîI'd love to discover movies from different countries that capture the nuances of youth, whether through quiet introspection, heartfelt drama, or unique perspectives.\n\nTo clarify, I‚Äôm open to all kinds of genres, as long as the central focus is on the experiences of young people. I‚Äôm also interested in any films that might offer a window into different cultures and the universal aspects of growing up.\n\nAny recommendations? Thanks so much in advance! I appreciate any suggestions!",

Also, it is gritty and visceral and putting the viewer at unease knowingly, not many jokes in these mentioned so relentless is good. Serial killer hunting works, doesn't need to be that though. Also, I kinda hate where in the \"who done it\" the end reveal is that it's protagonists brother or partner or someone else who's been fake hunting them selves... stuff like that, to me it cheapens the experience.\n\nThank you so much for suggestions :)",

Black Christmas the best of the unofficial trilogy, and I haven't seen many people talking about Bob Clark's style and influences. All 3 films are elevated by fantastic scores by Carl Zittrer, and all have a gritty, low budget feel to them. Clark quickly abandoned the horror genre, but I remain fascinated with these films. The films all contain interesting panning shots and zooms, and all films feel like cautionary tales, utilising classic tropes and urban legends like The Babysitter and the Man upstairs, The Monkey's Paw - although CSPWDT feels a lot like a zombie exploitation film. \n\nI am interested if there is directors or movies that Bob Clark has mentioned as being an influence to him. For some reason Mario Bava comes to mind - specifically Black Sabbath, but maybe that's just me",

Haven‚Äôt watched a ton of horror/sci-fi while high so don‚Äôt really know but some movies in that genre I really enjoyed while sober were interstellar, 2001 A Space Odyssey, The Conjuring Series. \nAlso, I really enjoy films that involve money and are well developed, Wolf of Wall Street, the big short and margin call were enjoyable for me.
