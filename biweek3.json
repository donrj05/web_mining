        "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nA bit more than 24 hours ago, I've asked you for your most favorite movie set in Serbia, and to be honest, as an outsider, I'm absolutely surprised. Not so much about the fact, that *A Serbian Film* didn't win (okay, a little bit about that too), but more about how much hate it got especially by - as it seems to me - the Serbs themselves. As a result, instead of this very unappetizing film, ***Balkanski špijun*** (engl.: *Balkan Spy*) has now won the contest.\n\nBut no sooner has a new movie earned its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) than we move on to the next country. Now it's all about **Slovakia** and as the 41 times before, there are only two rules to have in regard in this game:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 41: Serbia - Balkanski špijun (engl.: Balkan Spy)\n\n>Day 40: San Marino - Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino (engl.: Unknown Men of San Marino)\n\n>Day 39: Russia - Сталкер (engl.: Stalker)\n\n>Day 38: Romania - 4 luni, 3 săptămâni și 2 zile (engl.: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)\n\n>Day 37: Portugal - Capitão Falcão (engl.: The Portuguese Falcon)\n\n>Day 36: Poland - Krótki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n>Day 35: Norway - Flåklypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n>Day 34: North Macedonia - Нема да бидеш сама (engl.: You Won’t Be Alone)\n\n>Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n>Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n>Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n>Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n>Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n>Day 28: Luxembourg - Läif a Séil (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n>Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Kriminālās ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)\n\n>",

        "title": "A small defense of Live Action Remakes",
        "selftext": "So everytime a trailer or poster for a new live action film drops, there are three types of generic negative comments rehashed again and again. They're kinda irritating so I'm just gonna get them out of the way first before I make my actual case for Live Action Remakes\n\n\n**\"wow another cashgrab\"**\n\nYes movies are made to make money, obviously there are passion projects but making money is the goal even for a lot of passion projects. Literally 99% of movies are cashgrabs\n\n**\"Who asked for this\"**\n\nThis one is the most annoying. Nobody asked for The 1982 remake of The Thing either and it became a classic, and before you bring out the pitchforks, I'm not comparing The Thing to the shitty Lion King remake or whatever. It's just to show that something being made with zero demand isn't a fucking critique. These remakes also make a boatload of cash, so it isn't even all that accurate. Anyway this is the dumbest bottom of the barrel comment imaginable. \n\n**\"stop ruining my childhood\"**\n\nYour childhood is still there, you can still watch them at anytime. A live action adaptation doesn't delete the existence of those films or ruin the continuity. Heck a certain amount of those classic Disney film even have shitty DVD sequels or TV shows we'd rather forget about \n\n\nOK we're done, now for my actual argument. This isn't a defense of the quality of live action remakes, they still have way more misses than hits. I personally only digged one of them which is the Jungle Book. However, this negative attitude where people believe **it shouldn't be made** is what I'm vehemently against. Movies SHOULD be made, even bad ones. Stories have a right to be showcased in whatever medium imaginable \n\nLike take Aladin for example, it's generally believed to have originated in Arabia, through folk tales, then it became a book, then an animated movie, then a Broadway show, probably missing a few sequential steps but you get the gist of it. A live action movie is simply the next step, a new medium. Saying it shouldn't have been made is like saying it shouldn't have moved to Broadway, or even be made into an animated film.\n\nLive action remakes are just another form of recreational storytelling, sure a lot of it has to do with making more money but it's still part of the human desire to experiment with new avenues and tools. Saying it shouldn't exist because you don't like it doesn't make sense. Do you think fan films shouldn't exist cause most of them are shit? If your answer is no then imagine Disney remakes as an expensive fan film of a fan film of a book or tale.\n\nLike fucking get a grip. Where do you even draw the line on preserving the purity of your precious childhood gems, do paradies count? Should I drop down to my knees and start balling my eyes out when I encounter a different version of Pocahontas on pornhub",

        "title": "Italian cinema: a brief summary from my POV",
        "selftext": "# This is a summary of my thoughts on Italian cinema and its evolution, with a FOCUS ON ITS DECLINE AND RETURN. I’d love to hear other perspectives and expand the discussion. What do you think?\n\n* **Golden Age:** The triumphs of Italian cinema.\n* **Decline:** The exploitation of cinema and loss of relevance in the 1980s.\n* **Mediaset Monopoly:** How Mediaset and generalist TV took over.\n* **Internet & Streamers:** The rebirth driven by the internet and streaming platforms.\n\n# Golden Age\n\nItalian cinema has always been a global powerhouse. During the silent film era, Italy produced massive historical epics, featuring hundreds of extras and drawing from its rich history (from the Roman Empire to *The Divine Comedy* and beyond).\n\nDuring World War II, Italian cinema shifted toward propaganda, moving away from artistic creativity to serve political power.\n\nAfter the war, *neorealism* was born. While Hollywood was stuck under restrictive production codes, Italian filmmakers were telling raw, universal stories about post-war struggles—groundbreaking narratives that resonated far beyond Italy’s borders.\n\n# Decline: The Exploitation of Cinema\n\nIn the '60s and '70s, Hollywood abandoned its production codes, and by the '80s, the advent of visual effects caused a major shift. The U.S. soared to new global heights in filmmaking, far surpassing Italian cinema.\n\nItaly, meanwhile, struggled to modernize. The loss of the neorealist pioneers left a vacuum, and new filmmakers turned to short-sighted strategies. They leaned into low-budget projects that mimicked blockbuster aesthetics, piggybacking on Hollywood trends to squeeze out quick profits. This led to a drop in quality and, more importantly, respect from audiences. Italian cinema became synonymous with mediocrity.\n\n# Mediaset Monopoly\n\nAround the same time, television was rising as a dominant force in entertainment, pulling audiences away from theaters. By the late '80s, Mediaset was founded.\n\nThrough the '90s and 2000s, Mediaset capitalized on this shift, creating a cultural monopoly. Anything produced or aired by Mediaset was consumed by the vast majority of Italians, if not the entire audience.\n\nMediaset cultivated its own *star system*, building celebrities rather than artists. The cultural output during this era? Talk shows, game shows, reality TV, and low-quality films and series—cheaply produced and aimed purely at generating profit and mindless entertainment.\n\n# Internet & Streamers: A Rebirth\n\nWith the rise of the internet, younger generations shifted their attention online, leaving behind the Mediaset-dominated culture that had shaped Italy for decades.\n\nBy the 2010s, platforms like YouTube had become major hubs for youth entertainment. Around 2018, streaming services started cutting into Mediaset’s once-dominant share. Netflix led the charge, followed by Prime Video and Sky. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram later became central sources of creative content.\n\nToday, Mediaset’s cultural monopoly is largely a thing of the past, especially among younger Italians. While older generations (those from the '70s and '80s) still keep their TVs tuned to Rai or Mediaset for programs like *Wheel of Fortune* with Gerry Scotti, younger people see traditional TV as outdated. It’s not personalized, it feels repetitive, and it’s not delivering high-quality content.\n\nAfter 40 years of cultural decline—from the exploitation of cinema to Mediaset’s reign—streamers have brought international standards to their Italian productions. They effortlessly outcompete the trashy, generalist programming of traditional TV. Meanwhile, social media is fostering a new wave of original, satisfying, and artistic content.\n\nA fresh *star system* is emerging, centered on genuine artistic quality rather than the superficial generalism that defined past generations.\n\n# What do you think? Is Italian cinema on its way to a true renaissance?\"",

He was no doubt iconic in The Big Lebowski of course, but I think his role as an older Kevin Flynn in Tron Legacy is something I always look forward to every single time I go and rewatch the movie.\n\nWhat about all of you? What are some of your favorite Jeff Bridges movies?",

I feel like there are so many shows that I need to start and ones that I started and need to finish, it's almost a job to get through them. \n\nTV used to be crappy shows and half funny sitcoms that you'd watch for a bit and then decide it was time for something decent, so you'd watch a film. Now the shows are a lot better, but they often aren't still as good as a film, but they suck you in. You get caught up in a sunken cost fallacy, you've stopped enjoying the show, but after 4 seasons you feel like it would all have been wasted if you don't keep going. \n\nI'm going to try and get back into watching and re-watching more films in the future, I wonder how many feel they are in the same boat as I am?",

        "selftext": "Most of the time, even when I like/love a movie, I can tell why someone might disagree (I love Avatar 2, but I agree with like 90% of the criticism and see them as valid). And vice versa, even if I hate something, I can usually tell why someone might like it (Infinity Pool was hot garbage to me, but I can see where somebody can be enthralled by the premise). I cannot do that with Beau is Afraid. It's just pure ass to me. Spoilers ahead.\n\nThe plot boils down to \"A controlling mother orchestrates her son's (Beau's) journey back home, torturing him every step of the way, only to kill him in the end\". This movie is noted as an absurdist black comedy- on its Wikipedia, so this isn't my perspective-, but it's not funny. I've literally laughed more watching Saw movies. I get dark humor, but dark humor has to have a proper target. There's no rocket science. It's a two-step process: remove sympathy for the target, then hurt them in unexpected ways. Beau is Afraid seemed to have skipped step one, so it feels like watching someone drown a sack of puppies for two hours.\n\nAnd the \"absurdist' angle doesn't work either. First off, all of the absurdity except for maybe the penis monster is mundane. The disparity between the scenes and reality are a light parody filter at-best. Characters weren't outrageous, they were just caricatures; I could easily see all of them in a GTA cutscene. Not old wacky GTA, but new, exaggerated-shitty-realistic GTA. Secondly, even that level of absurdity is watered down by the reveal that the mother's been orchestrating everything. Suddenly, the scenes like everything at the doctor's house and the time where everyone walked into his apartment complex become fully explained and there's no absurdity to it at all. I'll admit, the penis monster is a surprise, but it's a surprise 1:30 into the movie; it's a little late to try to establish the genre you claim to be. \n\nI'm not 100% hating 100% of its aspects. Visually, it has its moments, and the acting is fine, too, but good visuals and solid performances can't cover for shit writing and a hollow premise\n\nI'm just hoping someone can articulate what they liked about this movie so I can stop thinking I'm insane for seeing anything else than a pile of dogshit compressed into film reel.",

        "selftext": "Rewatched the Jim Carrey Grinch movie tonight. Idc what anyone says, this is the definitive version of the story. Don't get me wrong, the original animated short is a classic and always will be, but the Jim Carrey version will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the only Dr. Seuss film that updates the original story, while still sticking true to what the original book standed for, if not enhances it.\n\nNot to mention the set design is absolutely phenomenal, and Jim Carrey as The Grinch is everything. Not just the makeup work, which is also phenomenal, but his performance as well. Unlike Mike Myers Cat in the Hat, who was just phoning it in to the point where it felt like he didn't even want to be there, Jim Carrey put 110% into his performance, he almost became one with the suit and captured the character perfect, while still adding his own energenic flair that Carrey is known for.\n\nIt's not perfect, not all the jokes land, I could do without seeing Grinch's face in....um......Melons, and while \"Where are you Christmas\" Is a beautiful song, in the context of the film, it feels out of place, especially since it's not a musical. But overall, I absolutely love this underrated classic, and I'm glad it's finally getting the recognition it deserves. Especially after the shit piece from Illumination. I hope we one day get live action Dr. Seuss films again, as long as they are like this one.",

        "selftext": "This is my second time watching this movie and it was a whole new experience. This film excels in the art of subtle foreshadowing and communication with excellent directing. This is clearly Park Chan-wook's most subtle film for sure. Among all the admirable qualities, I wanna talk about the use of technology in this film.\n\nDecision to Leave is hardly the only film that embraces the use of modern technology such as smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, and \"smart\" cars with touch screens. This film stands out because of how essential 2020s tech is, *despite* the fact that the relationship between humanity and technology is not the central theme of the narrative.\n\nThis is unlike films like Her (2013), which does integrate the use of technology well, but it's the central theme. I would say that Decision to Leave is similar to Happy End (2017) in this regard, but the former takes it to the next level.\n\n1. The film in in touch with how people ACTUALLY use modern tech devices\n\n* The dementia grandma is the only one in the film that uses the flip wallet phone case, which is such an old person moment.\n* The characters mainly text to communicate, which is realistic because almost no one these days actually *calls* on their phone. Only urgent subjects have the privilege of being discussed over calls.\n* Google translate is **immediately** pulled out when talking to foreigners\n* Almost every video is watched on Youtube phone app\n* Almost every piece of evidence is displayed through the phone (Seo-rae's Chinese criminal record, her grandpa's award, etc.)\n* Seo-rae's x-rays and domestic violence bruises are displayed on a monitor (with the investigator hovering her cursor over the images to \"point\") instead of the traditional radiographic film and photo prints.\n* The \"captain's log\" dialogue is recorded in the voice memos app\n* This film takes advantage of the subtle convenience of having wireless earpieces, which allows two people to share without being tangled up\n* The scene where Hae-jun is struggling to modify his response cuz Seo-rae is responding rapidly on text is an experience we've all had lmao.\n\n1. Tech devices as plot devices, instead of plot hinderances. Most films tend to make periods pieces or just ignore technology entirely because they kinda fix a problem that a narrative wants the characters to face. This film not only embraces these devices, but it utilizes them for the plot.\n\n* The male buddy cop texted someone, and the other person he was texting clearly was not using an iphone cuz his imessage was green. It is interesting to see how the film assigns some people to have green or blue text bubbles whenever they are texting the iphone-owning protagonist.\n* The step tracker actually was the reason how Hae-jun figured out that Se-rae killed her husband\n* The recording of Hae-jun's confession led to Seo-rae killing her second husband\n\n1. The film stylistically complements these tech devices\n\n* I adore the shots where we get a POV of the phone facing the sky and the characters. I like how the phone screens are mirrored and transparent as well.\n* I like the \"switch\" of perspective to the phone camera's perspective, along with how beautiful it looks. I feel like Park chose the iphone because of its camera quality and how aesthetic its camera app looks\n* I love the part where the two leads look at each other longingly each with an airpod in one ear\n* Near the ending, Hae-jun and Seo-rae pause and rewind audio recordings. This is accompanied by how the visuals are paused and rewound accordingly\n\nOverall, I'm pretty sure people already noticed this; I just wanted to articulate my appreciation for this.\n\nEDIT: word choice",

For all the things I have picked up on after several viewings (the twist getting revealed in literally the first two shots, \"But where's his brother?\", etc, etc,), the most recent viewing showed me a couple more things that I missed.\n\n- Robert Angier hinting at being Lord Caldlow earlier in the film. When his wife suggests The Great Danton as his name, he mentions that he did not want to ever embarrass his family name. This seems to be a hint to her that he does not want to embarrass her but upon knowing the twist, you realize he is actually referring to the idea that he is Lord Caldlow and Robert Angier is just an alias.\n\n- Cutter mentions that Borden is a great magician but a dreadful showman. We see this in his laughably bad show at the pub as well as when he is doing The Transported Man for the first time. \"Just a rubber ball huh? Its not just a rubber ball. Its magic.\" But then we see later when he has Root strung up and lowers him onto Angier's stage, he puts on a masterfully dramatic show of \"There is just too much magic for my stage! PARDON MY INTRUSION! And go easy on the poor chap, he does try so very hard!\" At first glance it appears that he has just grown as a performer but upon knowing the twist, it makes more sense to see that there is two of them and one is much more charismatic than the other.\n\n- The influx of side characters: Cutter even just straight up says that having a pretty assistant is critical to misdirection. But while Olivia actually does play a part in the plot, there are several characters that get significant attention that do not take the plot anywhere, even though they are portrayed as having some deep importance. These would be Owens, the Judge, Aly (not sure how its spelled), even the dude at the hotel drops some intense false-tension (\"I don't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box\"). For the most part, none of these people factor in at all. However, they all masterfully distract from the one side character that actually is the key to everything: Fallon. Even after seeing the film so many times, it is easy to straight up forget about Fallon when he is on screen. I think that the many side characters are there as a means of misdirection so that no one ever really pays any attention to the \"real\" prestige.\n\nGreat fucking movie. Any other things you have picked up on after the 12th time through or so?",

        "selftext": "Ok so it's a horror/comedy about an asian(?) Burglar and his girlfriend who work with 1 or 2 others.  The beginning of the movie has the main character arrested during a botched job.  Either he goes to jail or can't get in trouble again without going to jail...but he needs money for a debt I believe.  His girlfriend convinces him to take 1 last job with 1 goofy really tall burglar who's sort of a gangsta asian dude maybe he was her brother?  So they break into a guy's house and find a woman chained in the basement and then they free her.  I remember the twist at the endingish being that it was her kink to be chained down there and she was with the killer home owner all along.  \nIt was a very similar movie to the collector series,  that war veteran movie where the kids break in, but for the life of my I can't find the name anywhere online from Google searches.  It was kind of low budget....legit hilarious at times and really well made I feel like for it's budget.\nAnyone have any clue wtf I'm talking about?\nFor some reason I feel like the cover of the movie had artwork with a green background like lime green maybe.\n",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI watch a decent amount of horror films and a trope that I hate in the genre is when the villains are seemingly omnipotent by which I mean this like:\n\n1. They win no matter what\n2. Nothing they do ever fails in any way\n3. Nothing the main characters do has any impact on the outcome\n4. Even if the main characters destroy/win somehow the villain is just back at the end\n\nThis can look a lot of ways depending on the kind of villain in the film but the principal is similar. \n\nI personally find these kids of endings really boring I think because they feel totally unreal and not analogous to the real world as I perceive it. I once complained about this regarding a specific movie and a friend said she loved the ending because it was realistic (she's a very cynical person). \n\nI'm wondering what you guys think of this trope on general. Anyone else find it boring and tired like me?\n\nAlso do any of you have any suggestions for good horror films that somehow subvert this?\n\nFilms that I think subvert this and are good include:\nThe Orphanage (Spanish film)\nBabadook\nAlien\nThe mist (though holy hell that ending has it's own problems lol)\n\n",

As expected, it wasn't easy to find any movie that fits to the criteria here, but I think, we've found a winner which in a way reflects the heart of this journey very well: ***Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino*** (engl.: *The Unknown Man of San Marino*) is absolutely one of those hidden gems I hoped to find during this project.\n\nToday, I think, it will be easier again to find movies and to be honest, I think, that it's very easy to guess the winner that will take its place on [our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/). We turn our attention to **Serbia** and, as always, have only two rules to follow:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed.

Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if your movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 40: San Marino - Lo Sconosciuto di San Marino (engl.: The Unknown Man of San Marino)\n\n>Day 39: Russia - Сталкер (engl.: Stalker)\n\n>Day 38: Romania - 4 luni, 3 săptămâni și 2 zile (engl.: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days)\n\n>Day 37: Portugal - Capitão Falcão (engl.: The Portuguese Falcon)\n\n>Day 36: Poland - Krótki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n>Day 35: Norway - Flåklypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n>Day 34: North Macedonia - Нема да бидеш сама (engl.: You Won’t Be Alone)\n\n>Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n>Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n>Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n>Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n>Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n>Day 28: Luxembourg - Läif a Séil (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n>Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Kriminālās ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)\n\n>",

I thought it because It's just really strange, Firstly them knowing C was a witness, how would they know that? Did a witness tell them? And if so why didn't they ask THAT witness what they thought rather than the child, furthermore how did that witness know what C's name was? Secondly, they never bring C or Lorenzo to a police station or something that looks more formal, they just line some guys up on the street and ask C who did it, And Thirdly all the suspects were in the mafia. There's more, like how they're both Italian American And It's a very strange way to ask a witness what they thought. As to why the Mafia would do this, It's likely a way to see if they thought C was worthy of becoming a mobster later in life as they've seen him at the bar before looking at sonny, though Sonny wasn't the boss at this point so this might be unlikely, It's also possible this was just to determine if they should kill C or silence him somehow incase the Real police were to ask him. There's some parts that make me think otherwise, like how there is other cops there but they could easily be bribed/fake too, and that mainly, it makes sonny's character look way worse morally but then again he wouldn't be calling the shots at this point and that Mafia dressing up as police is a little silly but has happened before.. Just a thought i had while watching it though, could definitely be unintentional and all a coincidence what do you all think?",

        "selftext": "in 2016, HBO aired the movie confirmation, a movie about the clarence thomas congressional hearings. although it's not among the most famous HBO original movies, the film was acclaimed when it was aired and was even nominated for a few awards. the film has also made several lists of the best HBO original films, which considering their filmography is no easy feat.\n\nin my opinion, one of the best things about the movie is the performances. of course, you have kerry washington and wendell price as anita hill and clarence thomas respectively. however, another important character is joe biden since he's the one who oversaw the hearings. in the film, biden is portrayed by greg kinnear and he gives a really stellar performance in my opinion. not only is he a dead ringer for a young joe biden but he captures his mannerisms and voice perfectly. kinnear captures the essence of biden without dipping into parody and, as a result, gives one of his best performances in my opinion.\n\nit is not uncommon for real life people who are still alive when biopics are made about them to comment on their portrayals. i'm kind of curious if joe biden himself had anything to say about kinnear's performance. does anyone know if biden has ever commented on kinnear's portrayal of him or the movie in general? i mean, the clarence thomas hearings are a pretty significant part of biden's legacy so there's no way that he isn't aware of the movie.",

I live in a small city in Quebec, and here, it's all about American flicks and movies in French. It took a tourist who came to town to make me discover that beautiful world of foreign movies. 've got nobody to discuss films with, around a cup of coffee. I wish i had! For example, my favorite movie is \" Last life in the universe\" by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang from Thailand. It was released in 2003, and i still watch it once a year. I'm also a big fan of the work of Tsai Ming Liang from Taiwan. His movies hold a very dear place in my heart. Over the years, i've seen tons of movies that were never released in local cinemas, that never went popular here. When i'm trying to make friends, it always kind of upsets people that i don't \" encourage\" our local culture. I mean, i wish i could enjoy it, but i don't. What can one do? I've never come across people here, who know the movies i love, and that's kinda sad.....( just a little) \n\nDo you feel lonely with your tastes as well?",

        "title": "Gone Baby Gone (2007) is the ultimate moral conundrum on film. Lots of spoilers.",
        "selftext": "I first saw Gone Baby Gone the day it opened in theaters, mostly because I was more curious to see how Ben Affleck's directorial debut turned out after four years of him being the punchline of every Bennifer joke in existence throughout that weird period in pop culture. But also because I saw it was an adaptation of another Boston-set Dennis Lehane novel, and Mystic River became an instant favorite of mine in late 2003, and everything I'd read about the novel Gone Baby Gone convinced me this was gonna be another Lehane multi-layered mystery tragedy. I loved it after leaving the theater, but I didn't expect it to stick with me as long as it did. Patrick's decision to get Jack Doyle arrested once he figured out the entire conspiracy behind Amanda's kidnapping making all the other characters hate him for giving Amanda back to her mother is one of the reasons it stuck with me; I kept asking myself over and over if he made the right decision. Was doing the legally correct thing the morally correct choice?\n\nWhen it was released on DVD and I got to rewatch it, it finally hit me why the ending stuck with me so much; other than Helene going right back to her old self now that Amanda was home safely, Amanda correcting Patrick on her doll's name hit me like a fucking Mack truck. Throughout the entire movie, Amanda being taken while in possession of her doll named Mirabelle is mentioned several times; Patrick, now on babysitting duty because Helene didn't think to hire one for her date with a \"fan\" of her talk show interviews, sees Amanda playing with her doll and asks, \"Is that Mirabelle?\" Little Amanda responds with \"Annabelle\". \n\nNow, it's entirely possible this was a new doll purchased for Amanda after Mirabelle took a dip in that quarry's lake, but the look on Patrick's face before it cuts to the credits tells me he realized in that moment that **no one,** not even Amanda's aunt who hired and then stiffed Patrick and Angie, knew the actual name of Amanda's doll, since the media reported multiple times that Amanda had her \"doll named Mirabelle\". Helene and Bea likely would've corrected the record that the doll's name was Annabelle since they were the only two characters who actually wanted the mystery of Amanda's kidnapping solved. But no one corrected the record, so \"Mirabelle\" was the name mentioned several times *until* Amanda corrected Patrick; it's that look on his face as [Alexi Murdoch's \"Through the Dark\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPng8o3zDqM) starts playing that made me realize why this movie stuck with me so much. Patrick put his life and relationship on the line to save this little girl for a woman whom everyone else saw as the drug addicted neglectful horror show of a mother she had been, and lost pretty much everything for doing it: Angie left him and hated him for ripping Amanda away from the nice police captain in the nice, safe home and giving her back to Helene and *didn't* even get paid for all the shit he and Angie went through.\n\nPatrick is the ***only*** character who sees how much pain and torment Helene is experiencing, which explains his ultimate decision and why Angie hates him for it; Angie was never around to see how truly sorry Helene was for her actions leading to Amanda's kidnapping. While others, and the audience, may rightfully disagree with Patrick's decision, pay attention to the times when Helene breaks down on your next rewatch, and you'll better understand why Patrick chose the way he did; no one else saw that side of Helene, they just saw the drug addicted neglectful mother, which was used as the justification for a whole bunch of crimes. Also, I think Patrick's Catholic guilt over executing Corwin Earle was another big deciding factor in him trying to do what he saw as the morally and legally correct choice, and Remy's little motivational speech -- which got the ball rolling for Patrick to realize the truth behind Amanda's kidnapping -- outside the hospital did *nothing* to relieve Patrick's guilt, nor did Angie's pride in Patrick for it. And *goddamn* was Ed Harris a fucking powerhouse in that scene outside the hospital after Nick was shot. If 2007 hadn't been so stacked with amazing Supporting Acting nominations, including Casey Affleck himself as Robert Ford, I'm betting Harris would've been nominated, even if he had *zero* chance of beating Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh.\n\nI also think it's interesting how the *major* mystery of the movie is seemingly solved an hour before the movie ends. But as this was yet another Dennis Lehane multi-layered crime mystery, it makes sense. Little Amanda running out that door and happily jumping into Doyle's arms was one of the biggest mind fucks in a movie since finding out that Dave Boyle was >!entirely innocent of Katie Markum's murder, that he'd actually murdered a pedophile\\*!< in Mystic River, making [\"The last time I saw Dave Boyle was 25 years ago, going up this street in the back of that car.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9k-uO50300) one of the most tragic movie quotes of this first quarter century. Doyle's entire justification speech to convince Patrick not to report this is the centerpiece of the story's main thesis on doing what's legally or morally correct, which is also apparently the main topic of the [novel's sequel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_\\(novel\\)) Angie's tearful \"She's happy here. I saw her.\" does nothing to help Patrick's difficult decision.\n\nFuck, I love this movie. It's a great addition to the New England Tragedy pentalogy dominated by the brothers Affleck: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, The Town, Manchester by the Sea. Oh, and it needs to be said that Harry Gregson-Williams' scores for this and The Town are some of the most haunting film scores in the last 20 years.\n\nAnd RIP to both Michael K. Williams -- still weird to see him in a police uniform after knowing him as Omar Little for so long -- and John Ashton, who just passed away in September.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^\\*figured ^I'd ^spoiler ^tag ^that ^one ^since ^this ^post ^is ^mostly ^about ^Gone ^Baby ^Gone, ^not ^Mystic ^River.",

I get the first 2 hours is meant to be dream like and yes it did feel dream like, it also felt like complete wank. Every half an hour i’d tell myself “it’s going to get better” it didn’t. \nObviously i’m in the minority with my dislike towards the film so i’m not going to act like i’m completely correct but i feel like most people force themselves to like the film because of its concept and because it’s meant to be confusing, when in reality it isn’t. \nIt was all a dream. Okay? NICE, i’m pretty sure i utilised that plot twist when i was 11 and in primary school. \n\nEdit: \nI realised that i framed my entire dislike about the film around the fact i didn’t think the plot twist was stupendously confusing, i want it to be apparent that that’s not my main reason for disliking the film, it probably came out this way because the majority of praise i see for the film always surrounds this idea of confusion. This is ofcourse not my main reason for disliking the film, that’d be silly, i just couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it.

        "selftext": "It bothers me to this day that people repeatedly put forth the Mayan God theory as an origin story of the Creeper as if the idea of Mayans worshipping the creature informs us as to its true nature. Unless ancient Mayans had the power by worship to physically cause or manifest the thing itself that was to be worshipped, then it's not a helpful explanation of its origin. \n\nThe Creeper must have existed before or independently of the Mayans and therefore is not elementally a Mayan God.  Them possibly worshipping it explains nothing, much like any pagan civilization worshipping the sun in the sky does nothing to explain its formation. \n\n When most people ask, what is the Creeper, we are looking for theories on how and when and why it came into existence. Was it naturally birthed? Intelligently designed? Is it of earthly origins? Extraterrestrial? Obviously, we don't have any answer, only guesses. But just saying it's a Mayan God is uninformative. It would also raise the question of whether the Aztec Gods and Incan Gods and Egyptian Gods, and Greek Gods, Roman Gods and the Christian God also all exist and in the same universe?",

        "selftext": "I remember watching this with my parents when I was younger, prob around 95. I was born 88 so I didn’t have any ability to pick up any of the satire but I remember enjoying it.\n\nI have a bad habit of not rewatching movies I’ve seen since there’s so much out there, no matter how young I was when I first saw it, but my wife showed me a clip from the film off Instagram and we laughed and decided to give it a try and let me tell you it blew us away. We were crying laughing while totally engaged. \n\nIt’s a perfect LA satire and probably the only American Magical Realism film I’ve ever seen (I’m more familiar with the genre coming from Mexico).  Everything is pitch perfect. It’s a tight 91 minutes, edited beautifully, perfect writing from Steve Martin, directed as only I could imagine it and the casting is insane. Every side character and bit part is an amazing character actor from the 90s. \n\nAnd the leads are played beautifully by Richard Grant who I know from his performance in Withnail and I. Victoria tennent plays the love interest who is a beautiful actress who got stuck with bad roles most her career, but honestly Sarah Jessica Parker steals the show with her pre-emptive manic pixie dream girl. \n\nI think this is a movie that although critically acclaimed went over most peoples heads and was forgotten. But I sit here now thinking it’s just leapt to my favorite comedy of all time. It’s so sharp and witty and well executed and magical and of it’s time. I don’t think anyone can argue that Steve Martin is a comedic writing force and it shows in this movie. \n\nIf you haven’t seen it watch it as soon as you can, if you have what do you think about my analysis and how it’s held up and its legacy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. \n\nMy favorite joke so when Sarah Jessica Parker is trying to seduce Steve Martin and guides his hand down to cup her breast. He squeezes and makes a face and says “your breasts feel weird” and she says “oh, yeah, that’s cause they are real…”\n\nLa in a nutshell. That’s my Ted talk. ",

Also there is this lovely action scene which was EXHAUSTING (in a good way) because how real it felt.\n\nThis movie is more than relevant today ever before. Because we see so many influencers and internet personalities talking nonsense and even turning the real point.\n\nThe runtime is about 1hr 30mins, and even if you watch this type of films or not, you should watch it just for the concept.",

More like you choosing to pause the movie at a particular scene because it's revealing in some way interesting or revelatory or funny. Basically scenes that contain details you may miss the first time viewing.\n\nFor example there is that famous head splitting scene from T2 that you need to freeze the frame to see. Guy's head splits before being shot at. [https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png](https://i.imgur.com/cWZlQCg.png)\n\nBut I prefer more focus on interesting details in scenes than \"mistakes.\"\n\nLike in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, there are several scenes that need to be freezed, such as one involving Tom reading the paper. Sort of easter egg hunt thing.\n\nDo you have any you like to share?",

I get that she was curious, but was it really her place to interfere? Maybe it’s just me, but something about her actions throughout the movie rubbed me the wrong way. I can’t quite pinpoint exactly what it is—maybe it’s her need to control or her constant involvement in things that weren’t her business.

        "selftext": "Set in 1990, Krazy House starts as a typical late-80’s, early 90’s sitcom called The Christians that looks like an amalgamation of both Married with Children and King of Queens. Like those shows, it’s filmed in front of a live studio audience and starts out in a very light hearted, goofy way. Bernie Christian, the matriarch of the family, is juggling his faith and his family. He’s the stereotypical Kevin James kind of protagonist who means well, but continuously causes more problems than he’s solving. When he’s not falling down the stairs (much to the delight of the studio audience), he’s breaking everything that isn’t nailed down, much to the chagrin of his modern, breadwinning wife, Eva. His indifferent, gum smacking daughter Sarah and son Adam, a burgeoning scientist, are opportunities for life lessons about being good people and looking towards the lord. Sounds like the perfect setup for a religious TV show for those times; you know the type - a character walks through the front door and the crowd goes wild?\n\nHowever, when a trio of Russian handymen show up at the door, things take a turn…and the studio audience doesn’t pop for them. See, Bernie has (as he usually does), caused a mess in the kitchen. His stew bubbles over and he messes up the sink, adding to the kitchen destruction he caused earlier when his arm caught on fire and he lit up the wall. After initially dismissing the Russians, he lets them in to fix the problem…but the problems at the Christian house have only just begun. Once the Russians are in, the show takes an insanely dark turn and it only gets more bonkers from there. While the film starts as a deconstruction of the nuclear family sitcom, it ends as a bloody mess where no one is safe.\n\nThis one is for fans of absurd horror/comedies or things skewering nostalgic TV (Late Night with the Devil, Kevin Can F\\*\\*\\* Himself). The pacing isn't great in the second half, but it's still worth checking out.",

And with the aid of ***Wicked*** and ***Gladiator II***, it was the busiest weekend of the year.\n\nThe Top 10 earned a combined $269.2 million this weekend ($412.8 million five-day). That's not just a colossal 210% up from last year, but it's also the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever.\n\nDebuting on top, ***Moana 2*** earned a colossal $139.7 million in 4,200 theaters. Adding its numbers from Wednesday, the debut rises to $225.4 million in five days. It broke so many records, including the biggest debut for a Walt Disney Animation Studios film debut, as well as the highest Thanksgiving weekend. But most importantly; it beat ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($204.6 million) for the biggest Wednesday-to-Sunday debut. \n\nA fantastic debut all around, and it shouldn't be a surprise. If you've followed the Top 10 charts on streaming, you'll find that ***Moana*** has been one of the most streamed films in the past years. It was even reported that it was the most streamed film across all services last year. Needless to say, ***Moana*** became far more popular with years, and audiences hoped for a sequel to come.\n\nDisney, for some reason, was interested in doing it but only as a TV show for Disney+. In February 2024, it was revealed that the show was retooled into a film that would hit theaters this Thanksgiving. With an extensive marketing campaign, Disney successfully got people into giving this film a chance. \n\nAccording to Disney, 65% of the audience was female, and 60% was 18 and over. Critics were not enthused with the film, and it currently sits at 64% on RT. The audience was more forgiving, giving it an \"A–\" on CinemaScore, although that falls on the lower end of WDAS titles. There are no animated titles on its way until ***Dog Man*** in January, so it can leg out through the holidays. $500 million is pretty much guaranteed, and can go as high as $600 million if it can hold very well.\n\nAfter defying gravity on its opening weekend, ***Wicked*** continued flying high. It earned $81.1 million this weekend ($118.2 million five-day). That marks an insane 28% drop, which breaks the record set by ***Top Gun: Maverick*** (29%) as the smallest drop for a $100+ million opener. Of course, ***Maverick*** achieved that record on the weekend after Memorial Day, but it didn't face a $100+ million opener on its second weekend.\n\nThrough ten days, ***Wicked*** has earned a colossal $263.1 million domestically. It's already the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation, passing ***Grease*** ($188 million). Of course, ***Grease*** is still ahead in terms of adjusted inflation ($770 million), but ***Wicked*** remains a colossal success. It should hit $400 million without any problem, and the holidays can help it get close to $500 million by the end of its run.\n\nParamount's ***Gladiator II*** added $31 million this weekend. That represents a 44% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering how well the other holdovers did. Through 10 days, Ridley Scott's sequel has earned $111.4 million, passing ***Robin Hood*** and ***Black Hawk Down*** to become Scott's 6th highest grossing film domestically. The film should finish with over $150 million domestically, quite down from the original's $187 million lifetime gross.\n\nAfter a steep second weekend drop, Amazon MGM's ***Red One*** eased a light 4%, adding $12.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $75.8 million so far, and depending on next week's drop, it could still hit $100 million. Although it's hard to call this a bonafide hit considering its colossal $250 million budget.\n\nLionsgate's ***The Best Christmas Pageant Ever*** was still on the Top 5, easing just 6% and adding $3.2 million. The film has earned $31.9 million domestically.\n\nIn sixth place, Angel Studios' ***Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin*** fell 54% and added $2.3 million this weekend ($3.3 million five-day). That's a very weak drop, especially considering it had Thanksgiving. Through ten days, the film has amassed $9.6 million and will close with less than $15 million.\n\n***Venom: The Last Dance*** is still holding well, dipping 43% this weekend and adding $2.2 million. The film has amassed $137.8 million so far, which is still far behind the previous ***Venom*** films.\n\nA24's ***Heretic*** continues falling. This weekend, it fell 57% and added $956K this weekend. With $26.8 million in the bank, it's now gonna finish below $30 million.\n\nIn the face of ***Moana 2***, DreamWorks' ***The Wild Robot*** had its worst drop yet. It collapsed 67% this weekend, adding $700,000 to its run. The film has earned $142.5 million, and it's nearing the end of its run.\n\nRounding up the Top 10 was Searchlight's ***A Real Pain***, which recovered after its weak drop last weekend. The film dipped 39%, grossing $655,910 this weekend. The film has earned just $6.1 million, and barring some huge Oscar noms, it looks like it might miss $10 million.\n\nOutside the Top 10 was Focus Features' ***Conclave***, which dipped 46% and earned $616,955 this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $30.1 million domestically. A damn great run for an adult drama.\n\nNeon's ***Anora*** is winding down, and it's now playing in just 230 theaters. This weekend, it dipped 43% and added $385,292. Its domestic total stands at $12.7 million.\n\nA24 debuted Luca Guadagnino's ***Queer*** in 7 theaters, earning $188,808. That translates to a $26,973 per-theater average, which is quite middling (it barely cracks the top 20 highest PTA of the year). For comparison, it's barely above ***Bones and All*** ($24,201), and far below ***Suspiria*** ($92,019) and ***Call Me By Your Name*** ($103,233). The film will continue expanding through the holidays.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\nThe records don't stop just in America for ***Moana 2***.\n\n***Moana 2*** debuted with a colossal $163 million overseas, which means it debuted with $389.2 million worldwide. That broke ***Mario***'s record ($377 million) for the biggest animated debut in history. The biggest markets were France ($18.8M), UK ($15.5M), Mexico ($11.1M), Germany ($10.5M), Italy ($9.3M), South Korea ($9.1M), Australia ($8.3M), Brazil ($7.5M), China ($6.5M) and Spain ($5.5M). An easy billion right here, ladies and gentlemen. \n\n***Wicked*** is a monster hit domestically, but that popularity hasn't fully connected with the rest of the world. This weekend, the film earned $29 million from the overseas markets, taking the worldwide total to $360.3 million. It's still killing it in the UK ($36M) and Australia ($12.9M), and it has performed well in South Korea ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.7M), and Philippines ($3.5M). The rest of the markets... not so much. While it still has some markets left, the film will be domestic-heavy. The film is cleary a hit, but it's crazy how the domestic market represents a huge 73% of its worldwide gross.\n\n***Gladiator II*** added $27.2 million this weekend, and its worldwide total is now $320.2 million. The best markets are the UK ($29.7M), France ($22.5M), Spain ($15M), Mexico ($12.9M) and Australia ($11.5M). The film should pass the original's $272 million foreign gross, but it's unlikely it can pass its worldwide gross ($460 million).\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* | Sep/6 | Warner Bros. | $111,003,345 | $294,100,435 | $450,053,961 | $100M\n*Saturday Night* | Sep/27 | Sony | $3,400,583 | $9,509,312 | $9,752,378 | $25M\n*Terrifier 3* | Oct/11 | Cineverse | $18,928,113 | $53,981,071 | $94,436,616 | $2M\n\n- 36 years in the making and it paid off, as ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** closed with a fantastic $294 million domestically, finishing as Burton's second highest grossing film, just a little behind ***Alice in Wonderland*** ($334 million). Interestingly, that popularity wasn't as strong overseas, as the domestic market represented 65.3% of its worldwide gross. It's still a great $450 million worldwide, although ***Alice*** ($1 billion) and ***Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*** ($474 million) finished far higher. Despite a few duds here and there, Tim Burton is still as popular as he's ever been.\n\n- ***Saturday Night Live*** might be popular 50 years later, but that doesn't mean the audience is interested in a film depicting its first ever broadcast. That was the case for Jason Reitman's ***Saturday Night***, which closed with a very poor $9.5 million domestically. The film was positioned as an Oscars contender, but the film fizzled out by the time it hit wide release and faded quickly. Don't expect the rest of the world to save it, given that ***Saturday Night Live*** isn't as popular as the States. \n\n- Last month, we had two movies revolving around a clown as its protagonist. ***Joker: Folie à Deux*** became one of the worst received comic book films of all time, allowing Art the Clown to emerge as the winner of the month. And now, ***Terrifier 3*** has closed with a damn fantastic $94 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing unrated film ever. Shattered the ceilling of what a film like this could achieve, and elevating Art to one of the most iconic horror villains of modern times. Damien Leone has already confirmed a fourth film is coming up. Art in space when?\n\n#**THIS WEEKEND**\n\nThe post-Thanksgiving weekend is usually a dumping ground for studios. With the Christmas season kicking off, people are busy, which is why studios avoid releasing anything big. It's up to the small films to get a chance. This weekend, we have two newcomers and none of them stand a chance in dethroning ***Moana 2***. None will even touch $10 million this weekend.\n\nThe only one with a confirmed wide release is A24's ***Y2K***, which marks Kyle Mooney's debut as writer and director. The film stars Jaeden Martell, Julian Dennison, Rachel Zegler, Fred Durst, and Alicia Silverstone, and depicts an imaginative version of the Year 2000 problem, where a bug causes all technology to come to life and turn against humanity. The film has received mixed reviews (63% on RT), and horror comedies have not performed well as of late. We'll see how it does, but a debut under A24's ***Heretic*** ($10.8 million) seems pretty much imminent.\n\nThe other film, although in far less theaters, is Searchlight's ***Nightbitch***. A film that stars Amy Adams as a mother who transforms into a dog. Like, seriously. Y'all complain about lack of originality in Hollywood? Well, here's a very unique premise. Reviews are quite similar to ***Y2K***, and marketing has been very limited so far. This suggests it won't be a very wide release.\n\nAnd for those curious, Christopher Nolan's ***Interstellar*** is returning to theaters this Friday for a limited time on IMAX screens. You should hurry up, for screenings are quickly getting sold out.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in following the box office, come join us in r/BoxOffice, where a slightly altered version of this write-up can be found.",

Great movie until the ending which in my eyes completely ruined the brilliance of the film.\n\nI cannot make sense of the ending and wonder if I am missing something?\n\n1. Firstly, surely all the bullet in his wife's head does is proves Nunally's gun was the murder weapon. There is still nothing linking Crawford to Nunally's gun as it is mentioned in the film that the hotel camera footage has no face. \n\n2. Also, they switched the shells in the evidence locker so would the gun even match anymore? \n\n3. The double jeopardy also is very questionable. As I understand it, the case is still substantially the same so Crawford would still not be able to be tried again. \n\n4. Would any evidence collected in Crawford's house at the end not be void due to the restraining order? Beachum should not be there in the first place and it is essentially breaking and entering as he goes through Crawford's belongings to get the gun.\n\nGreat shame as I would have given the film a 9 up to the end which seems to completely ruin the rest of the film. Hopefully I am overlooking something which explains the ending.",

Fortunately, I also got some very good film suggestions (I would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants again) and we also have a winner: ***Сталкер*** (engl.

Murnau’s expressionistic vampire movie is commendably faithful to the 1922 silent film and more accessible than “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch,” yet eerily drained of life.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-gothic-vampire-romance-1236191438/):\n\n>Nosferatu may not click instantly, but, aside from the technical brilliance that superbly renders the late-19th century, there’s a baked-in longevity in its thinking that will surely keep people coming back.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/nosferatu-review-bill-skarsgard-lily-rose-depp-nicholas-hoult-robert-eggers-1236074321/) (100):\n\n>Every age gets its definitive film of Stoker’s vampire legend. Eggers has given us a magnificent version for today with roots that stretch back a century.\n\n[Collider ](https://collider.com/nosferatu-2024-review/)(9/10):\n\n>Nosferatu shows Robert Eggers at the height of his powers, building an atmosphere of choking menace anchored by magnificent turns from Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgard.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-dracula/):\n\n>Robert Eggers may not have rewritten the book of “Nosferatu,” and much of the film plays more like an update than a wholly new take, but he does justice to this material. And he does more than justice to Orlock: Eggers and Skarsgård give him new (un)life, empowering him in ways that make all the rest of us feel powerless.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-lily-rose-depp-1235071494/) (A-):\n\n>Eggers’ broadly suggestive script doesn’t put too fine a point on the specifics of Ellen’s repression, but Depp’s revelatory performance ensures that the rest of the movie doesn’t have to.\n\n[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/nosferatu-2024/) (4/5):\n\n>Despite its familiar story beats, Eggers’ retelling suffocates like a coffin, right up to its chilling final shot. Lily-Rose Depp is full-bloodedly committed, and Bill Skarsgård’s fiend gorges with terrible fury.\n\n[Bloody-Disgusting](https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3847134/nosferatu-review-robert-eggers-macabre-masterpiece/) (5/5):\n\n>It’s operatic and dramatic, bold and revolting, with a powerful final shot for the ages. And Eggers’ *Nosferatu* happens to be set over Christmas. That all but ensures this macabre masterpiece is destined to become a new holiday horror classic.\n\n[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/nosferatu-review/) (4/5):\n\n>Nosferatu delivers a relatively straight re-telling of this classic gothic tale. It looks and sounds stunning and is packed with vampiric horror. It doesn't push many boundaries but if you wanted the classic Dracula narrative feeling exactly like it’s directed by Robert Eggers, you're going to love it.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/nosferatu-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) (9/10):\n\n>Nosferatu is Robert Eggers' finest work, given how it both boldly stands on its own as a gothic vampire drama and astutely taps into the original texts — F.W. Murnau's silent classic and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.\n\nThe Independent (100):\n\n>Depp does magnificent work in embodying the sense of existing out of place, not only in the violent contortions and grimaces of supernatural possession, but in the way Ellen’s gaze seems to look out beyond her conversation partner and into some undefinable abyss.\n\nWritten and Directed by Robert Eggers:\n\n>*Nosferatu* is a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her, causing untold horror in its wake.\n\nRelease Date: December 25\n\nCast:\n\n* Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok\n* Nicholas Hoult as Thomas Hutter\n* Lily-Rose Depp as Ellen Hutter\n* Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Friedrich Harding\n* Emma Corrin as Anna Harding\n* Willem Dafoe as Prof. Albin Eberhart Von Franz\n* Ralph Ineson as Dr. Wilhelm Sievers\n* Simon McBurney as Herr Knock",

Give Mufasa a chance and don't judge it if you have not seen it yet.\nI think movie will be a solid 7-8 outta 10 but we have 2 weeks to know, what are your thoughts\n\nDefending Lion King cause it means a lot to me, I like these characters and wish it had more fareness, Mufasa is made with more love and respect than the first movie (the remake, not original)\nBut WATCH SONIC 3 FIRST, Shadows has a gun. Worth the ticket, and Im not saying Mufasa is gonna be better, Im saying that we should stop hating and atleast give it a chance.",

Why would someone so desperate to fit in also be driven to such extreme violence? The answer isn't what you think. Beyond the surface narrative of materialism and madness lies a hidden pattern. Once you see it, you'll never watch the film the same way again. More importantly, you might never look at human behavior the same way either. For viewers familiar with American Psycho, prepare to see familiar scenes in an entirely new light. This isn't just another movie analysis - it's a revelation about who we are and why we do what we do",

Alpha Waymond said early on that you had to resist the temptation to have extended stays in other dimensions otherwise you introduce paradox. But doesn't the movie end with Evelyn in another dimension? Her original dimension is the one where she doesn't go home from the IRS, punches Deirdre, the IRS has been basically destroyed, there's a lot of murder, Waymond is aware of raccoon-Waymond and raccoon-Joy, and Eveyln pulls Alpha-Joy out of the bagel. As the movie ends, we transition to a dimension where she DID go home, she has the breakdown in the laundromat, Dierdre tells the police to let her go, they relate to each other because of the divorce papers, then she has that last emotional talk with Joy at the car. I can't tell if it is implying that Evelyn is staying in this alternative dimension, or if her original one is still \"active\" for her and she probably goes to jail after all the verse-jumpers (Alpha gong-gong, alpha-Joy, alpha diedre, etc) leave that dimension.\n\n2. When Evelyn is having that talk reconcile with Joy at the car at the end of the movie, is it with HER Joy, or the Jobu Tupaki Alpha-Joy? It's clear in that universe that Alpha-Joy is taking over that universe's Joy quite often, and the speech carries references to other events in the movie and she's shown to be talking with Alpha-Joy in all of the other dimensions too. There's so much emotion flowing in that scene from Joy that I can't tell if Evelyn is reconciling with HER Joy, or Alpha-Joy.",

His movies are packed with high-stakes tension, larger-than-life heroes, and explosive action, but what about the women in these stories? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how they’re portrayed!\n\nHere are a few women in his films that stand out to me:\n\n* **Holly Gennaro McClane (*****Die Hard*****)**: She’s a career-driven, no-nonsense woman who also happens to be at the heart of John McClane’s emotional journey. Her strength comes across in the way she handles Hans Gruber and leads the hostages, but do you think she’s given enough agency beyond being someone for John to save?\n* **Anna (*****Predator*****)**: At first, Anna seems like a typical prisoner-of-war character, but she becomes a key figure in unraveling the Predator’s backstory. She provides a voice for her people and their legends. Does her role feel substantial, or does it fall into the trope of the \"exotic other\"?\n* **Virginia Baker (*****The Thomas Crown Affair*****)**: Rene Russo’s character is sharp, confident, and undeniably one of McTiernan’s most complex women. She’s Thomas Crown’s equal, which is rare in movies like this. Does she break the mold of how women are portrayed in action/thrillers?\n* **Whitney and Irene (*****Last Action Hero*****)**: This movie pokes fun at action clichés, and it’s fun to see the \"screaming damsel\" and \"grounded working-class mom\" tropes being played for laughs. What do you think McTiernan was trying to say about female characters in action films here?\n\nI know McTiernan’s films are heavily focused on their male leads, but I’m curious—do you think the women in his movies hold their own? Which characters stand out to you, and which feel underdeveloped?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and insights! 😊",

        "selftext": "Haven’t seen a post like this, so I figured I’d make one.\n\nWhat are the most fitting movies for each of the 12 months of the year? Which movies best fit the vibes and aesthetics of each month? Thought this might be an interesting discussion.\n\nJanuary: Something grim and desolate like Fargo would fit pretty good, wintery and cold and all\n\nFebruary: Equally as cold and miserable, but with the added benefit of Valentines Day. Some sort of romance movie with a wintery theme would fit here, especially if set on Valentines Day. Groundhog Day is also a strong contender.\n\nMarch-April: No specific ideas, these blend together for me. Movies about spring would fit for all of both.\n\nMay: Still springtime, but also end-of-school and graduation, so any moviess about graduating or school letting out would fit.\n\nJune-Aug: These blend together for me. Plenty of summer movies, but not necessarily specific to a month. I will say, August also has back to school as a potential setting or theme, and I personally associate that month with dreary, overbearing heat and fatigue, the kind of visuals heavily present in the film Falling Down\n\nSeptember: School is fully back in swing, and I would lean towards placing a High School movie or something here.\n\nOctober: There’s plenty of Halloween movies, but it would have to be one that celebrates fall and the month of October more so than just being scary. The miniseries Over the Garden Wall Would Fit, not sure of other examples \n\nNovember: Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be the easy choice for Thanksgiving, but I do wonder if there are any other films that would fire better.\n\nDecember: There’s a litany of holiday movies of course, but out of all of them there’s have to be one that embodies the month as a whole and not just Christmas time. A plot incorporating the advent season might work, like Christmas Vacation, or a film that incorporates New Years.\n\nI’m struggling with examples here, so I’d be excited to hear what others think",

        "selftext": "The movie Requiem for a Dream is quite popular and often receives high ratings and praise from people who just saw it. And it is indeed a well done movie, but it's not a realistic movie about drugs.\n\nI think of it more as a horror movie that uses drugs than a movie about people becoming addicted. It gets details wrong, like heroin makes you chill not all excited and energized. That's just one example.\n\nBut it works great as anti-drug advertising for people who have never done drugs before. And like I said, it's a pretty good movie from the artistic point of view. Like the visuals are so powerful you can't forget certain scenes for a long time. Combined with the great score, you are left at the end of the film with that sense of horror, of powerlessness in face of terrible doom, of things unraveling rapidly for everyone. It's a nightmare visualized really.\n\nSo my question is whether you find the movie realistic, especially if you or someone you know has done drugs. And if not, which movie you thought accurately showed what it's like to become addicted.",

        "title": "Contact is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I absolutely hate some of the ending",
        "selftext": "Major spoilers for the ending of Contact throughout the post, beware. \n\nContact is an absolutely amazing film in almost every way. The ending is also amazing in a lot of ways. Ellie's character development, from a die-hard skeptic in religion to having had an almost religious experience herself, is extremely moving, and the entire scene where she is in the Machine is spectacular in every way. However. \\[the scene where she is being interrogated by Kitz\\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0) and what comes after is extremely out of character and full of plot holes. \n\nOne of the things that makes Ellie's character so compelling is that she is a badass who stands up for herself, and she needs to be. Misogyny isn't talked about as explicitly in the film, but it isn't hard to read between the lines and see the way Drumlin constantly interrupts her and takes credit for her findings (even claiming to be the leader of the project he tried to kill) as a representation of sexism in the science field. This has happened to many, many female scientists throughout history (and is stated explicitly in the book). In order to get by with the cards stacked against her, \\[Ellie learns to stand up for herself\\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkEace3rb4) and is very contrary to the typical \"damsel in distress\" story. At the end, they completely betray that. Ellie lets Kitz, a minor antagonist throughout, yell at her and call her crazy. Then, just to twist the knife, Joss defends her where she didn't defend herself, and they ride off into the sunset.\n\nI have issues with the romantic arc between Joss and Ellie in general. Ellie is a genius who is passionate about astronomy; It's abundantly clear that she is very passionate about SETI. Being able to find and meet aliens is her life goal that she worked for all her life. Then Joss intentionally sabotages that goal by asking her an extremely loaded question that leads to her not getting chosen to meet the Vegans because he doesn't want her to die, and she's fine with that? Really? This man she slept with once and then saw again years later completely sabotages her life goal, and she doesn't even get mad? Personally, I don't care how madly in love I am, I would lose my shit if that happened. Most people would. Her reaction to that scene is incredibly out of character for her, but also out of character for pretty much anyone. \n\nBack to the ending: the plot holes. \n\n1. The chair was crushed during her trip, and Ellie only survived because she happened to have left the chair then (although I like to interpret it as her intuition saving her more than chance). If the pod fell through immediately as everyone else saw, either Ellie would have still been in the chair, safe and sound, or she would've been a pancake on the ceiling. It would've been impossible for her to have escaped the chair that quickly. This isn't mentioned at all, but would raise questions to anyone who saw the pod.\n\n2. As previously stated, Ellie isn't the type to let them walk over her like they do in the trial, and she's extremely smart. She absolutely would've asked to see the static that was recorded, and they wouldn't have been able to hide it without being *extremely* suspicious. They could have lied or edited it, and the ending with Ellie not being believed would've remained (and I do really like that part) without making her look spineless. \n\n3. They still have the Machine. They could've sent someone else, or hell, they could've sent a stopwatch if nothing else. Or a plant, or some poor canary. You get the idea. It really just isn't a \"we'll never know\" thing. IMO, if one wanted to preserve the movie's ending as much as possible while fixing the plot holes, the Machine should've been damaged in some way. I doubt the government could've justified building a third one.\n\nThose are my issues with the ending, but as I said, it is still an amazing movie. I just wish the ending had Ellie stay as the badass character she was. Having her lose her spine and become another damsel in distress just seems like a massive betrayal of her character.",

I honestly can’t believe this thing was greenlit.  \n  \nBen Stiller returns to the screen after seven years… and this is what he came back to?

I honestly thought I might scream. But we were too deep in at that point, so we kept watching. Spoiler: none of us enjoyed it.\n  \nThis movie feels like you’re stuck in a never-ending loop, with the same boring shots, the same settings, and the same tired characters repeating over and over again for 1 hour and 45 minutes. I’ve never regretted spending time on a movie more. I’m actually angry it exists.\n  \nDo yourself a favor and don’t waste your time.

        "selftext": "I recently rewatched The Prestige after many years and although it is a completely different and exciting experience, the third act kinda doesn't make any logical sense.\n\n# Obviously, big spoilers below as I will be discussing the ending so be forewarned...\n\nFirst of all, I just want to say that I love this movie and I think it's among one of Nolan's best films. This is really nitpicky, so I hope you will read this more as a fan poking holes than a criticism.\n\nThere are 4 parts of the story that I either didn't see or overlooked in my first dozen viewings. But now that I've seen it again after many years, I can't ignore these illogical choices.\n\n1. **Borden should have revealed their secret to save his own/brother's life.** I get that they have dedicated their lives to magic and withholding the secret but with the threat of a hanging, they should have said something if it gave them a chance at clemency. The surviving brother wouldn't have been able to keep performing magic anyways because the Alfred identity would also legally be dead; he'd have to start from scratch. And finally, by letting the trick die with one of the brothers, it makes Sarah's death even more meaningless. Taking the secret to the grave only makes thematic sense, but not logical sense.\n2. **Cutter kinda kidnaps Jess and no one really cares**. After one of the Borden twins in hanged, the surviving Borden teams up with Cutter to get revenge on Angier. (So I guess he ends up revealing his secret anyways?) They show Cutter sneaking onto Lord Caldlow's estate and grabbing Jess during the day, but Lord Caldlow is murder by Borden at night. If Jess was kidnapped the same day as the murder, wouldn't Caldlow have be extra careful and maybe not go to his warehouse alone? And if Caldlow was murdered the night before the kidnapping, wouldn't the house be extra careful to guard over Jess? This was ignored just to give Borden a happy ending.\n3. **Angier didn't need to keep killing this clones.** He literally could have made one clone and lived as twins, thus allowing him to perform the New Transported Man as Borden did. I get the initial shock of shooting the first clone, but to devise a plan to keep killing each sequential clone is illogical. In fact, I'm starting to believe that this was Tesla's initial design in the first place. Tesla doesn't strike me as someone who would build a cloning machine instead of a teleporting machine. I think he wanted to give Angier a perfect double so that he could perform the trick and enjoy the prestige half of the time. But story-wise, it would have been more poetic to drown night-after-night like his late-wife.\n4. **Angier couldn't have pulled off the Real Transported Man as shown in the film.** We only see this trick performed twice and both times, you kinda have to turn your brain off.\n   1. The first time is when Angier shows off the machine to Cutter and the talent manager. After he activates the machine, Prime-Angier just **disappears**. There was no trap door implemented yet; the talent manager is the one who suggests it. So at this point, there should be two Angiers and no way of killing either one of them.\n   2. The second time is during one of the Great Danton's 100-show-run. Prime-Angier falls through the trap door and into the water tank and Borden is framed for supposedly killing him. But why doesn't Clone-Angier complete the trick and reappear for the Prestige? Clone-Angier is all the way up in the wings of the audience so how would he know that Borden would be under the stage? Realistically, Angier wouldn't know which show of the 100 shows should be the one when he needed to fake his own death and not reappear.\n\nAll in all, the film WORKS better without logic. I mean it's about magicians and there's a fucking cloning machine in the 1800s. But I mainly wanted to bring these up just to make sure I wasn't going insane. Thanks for taking the time to read. I can't wait for the backlash and downvotes!",

I remember shaking my head confused and wondering if I just saw what I thought I saw.  \n\nI've done searches online over the years to see if anyone else has a memory of this and I've found nothing.

You have Anna's story, not a depressed, cheating wife, but a grieving widow. You have Malcolm trying to come to terms with his failure from years before but communicating his love for Anna. ",

Even until the end, I wished she had broken it off with her boyfriend before moving on, but I couldn't help but wish her and Will would spend their last moments together\n\nIt was nice to see a movie, especially knowing this was made in 2016 tackle assisted suicide so well in my opinion. Will had resigned his life, but still provided 6 months to his parents for things to turn around. His parents fought on both sides to help and stop him. Louisa's mum also was vehemtly against it and didn't want her daughter being involved as she knew this would upset her\n\nMy favourite scene overall was Louisa coming home to nod her head \"no\" towards her sister. I've had situation that resulted in a near identical scene and I knew how much that would've hurt\n\nI really enjoyed all the characters and the few bits of humour sprinkled throughout. The scenes were all engaging that what was originally \"I'm juat gonna sit here, you watch what you want\", turned into me glued to the screen after the first minute\n\nOverall, I don't think this movie has any real flaws and I'd consider it a 10/10. I was very surprised I had never heard of this one and even more surprised to see the bad reception regarding the assisted suicide topic. I do wonder how I would've felt had I watched it in 2016\n\nIf anyone out there has any recent thoughts, I'd love to hear them",

As soon as the movie reveals early on that he’s an identical twin I said “the twins switch, and the ‘dead’ one is the alive one,” and I ended up being spot on. For a mystery movie it was really quite lame because every time I see identical twins I’m going to think they switched and it’s part of, or maybe even the entire mystery. \n\nThis got me thinking.

After one hour, I felt so helpless for the characters, just as they might feel. After the movie, I just feel like it was such a sad, cold, depressing tragedy about unhealed trauma. Keller need of being in absolute control and completely selling his soul in order to not being hurt more. The guy still trying to do the mazes from when he was kidnapped. Alex Jones who was kidnapped and tortured. And perhaps the most subtely tragic, Detective Loki whole past of being abused that might have kept him from suspecting the woman. I believe that’s how he was didn’t see Alex suffering or the guy with the maze lighting a candle or acting their deaths. \n\nAll that to say, this film left me heartbroken for them. It’s a good thing with how these stories tend to be sensationalized through crime documentaries etc. But I would not say it’s a thriller, or a tragedy/drama with some real thriller mechanics. \nHow did you feel about this film?",

        "selftext": "I've asked myself this and as an avid movie goer, I thought the number would be much higher and find others tend to overestimate. \n\nI sat down and over time, did my best to list out every movie I have ever seen. I tried to narrow it down to movies I know for a fact I have watched beginning to end. Not \"oh, I saw 70% of it on television once\" or \"eh, I think i watched it when I was a kid.\" \n\nEspecially for things like ubiquitous Disney films. Everyone is seemingly fimiliar with Bambi, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, etc, but I think the number of people who watched these movies in their entirety is lower. And while I myself couldnt exactly remember a time where I didnt know these characters, I also couldnt remember taking the time to watch them as a kid. So I didnt count them. Unless I knew 100% I watched it. \n\nI also tried not to count television specials unless they were feature length and billed as a movie. Does Channel Chasers from the Fairly OddParents count as a movie or is it a tv special? It sounds dumb but unless it was billed as a movie, I tried to avoid counting it. Kim Possible The Movie: So The Drama may only be like 70 minutes and aired straight to Disney Channel, but I counted it. \n\nSo after counting movies I'd seen under the criteria and with a huge help from Letterboxd, I was able to pin down a rough estimate: \n\nAt the age of 27, I have seen about **1000-1100 movies**. I definitely watch more movies I havent ever seen now than I did maybe a decade ago so I am wondering how that number will look in the next 25 years of my life.\n\nIn my college days, I'd see roughly 40-70 movies a year? While not much at all relative to most film lovers, I would say definitely a higher number than the average person. This year, the number is over 100, and will likely finish at about 115-120. The number of movies I watch per month tends to fluctuate greatly. Sometimes I get more into television or video games or too busy with social life to be watching movies. In March, for instance, I had only seen one movie and it was Dune 2. But back in September, I had managed to watch 25 movies. ",

No, James Bond is the man's actual name and in fact, the events of OHMSS are referenced throughout the Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan Bond movies.",

Fight scenes are rather frenetic, with lots of wild slashing with rapiers (??) and odd camera work where we go from big distance shots with lots of people to a sort of hand-held following of individual actors.  \n\nWe all know the story, right?   I read Dumas in high school, and then later as an adult as well.   There have been literally dozens of adaptations of the story.\nSo I wonder… Why would the director decide to simply toss out major plot elements from Dumas, and then throw in plot elements that were apparently invented for this film?   \n\nI can understand wanting to put a little different spin on this well-worn tale…. But I found this rather jarring. \n\nI have to admit, my favorite is still the 1973 Lester-directed version with Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, etc. ",

Great soundtrack and vibes reminiscent of David Mamet films.\n\nA Simple Plan - The story flows flawlessly from beginning to end. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton are perfect casting. One of the few films I loved so much that I read the book (the first 80% is beat for beat the same as the film, but that last 20%, damn).\n\nThe Way of the Gun - Brilliant film by Christopher McQuarrie before he became tied at the hip with Tom Cruise. Benicio del Toro's best performance IMHO.\n\nHonorable mention - Bloodline (season 1 especially), Full Circle on Max has a lot of these vibes.\n\nWhat others?",

        "selftext": "For me, it's Maria de Medeiros as Fabienne, Butch's girlfriend in Pulp Fiction. The movie is a masterpiece, but every time she's on screen, I cringe. Her character is overly naive and borderline cartoonish, and her delivery feels so out of sync with the tone of the film. I get that she's supposed to be a contrast to Butch, but it just doesn't land for me. What about you—what's a character or performance that drags down an otherwise fantastic movie?\n\n",

I didn't have a problem with this or anything in previous films, I just think it's been done to death with OHMSS, the Spy Who Loved Me, Casino Royale, Spectre and No Time to Die. \n\nBringing back the supporting actors from the Craig era would also be one of my personal hopes. Such as, Ralph Fiennes as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. Everyone else can be new, but I would like to keep Bond tradition of keeping the same supporting actors. If I could only keep ONE actor, I'd say Whishaw because I'd love to see him stick around for decades like Desmond Llewyn did. \n\nBut what do you think? ",

The longer the movie goes on the more difficult it is to believe what you are seeing. Oldman struggles with his Boston accent a few times but overall he gives an above average performance in a movie I think you’ll enjoy.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. I'm working on a script in which the main character is undergoing a medical procedure and is having a dream while doing so. I want the scene to jump from the \"dream world\" to the real world.   \n  \nDo you have any references I can use for these types of scenes? To be extra specific, I'm looking for specific scenes (not entire episodes) where a character is unconscious/incapacitated (in a chair, bed, medical table, etc.) while experiencing a vision/dream/memory, and the scene switches between:\n\n* Their physical body (often monitored or observed by others)\n* What they're experiencing in their mind\n\n**The most basic example that comes to mind is** *The Matrix*: Neo fighting Agent Smith.\n\nWould love to get some suggestions.\n\nThanks!",

He's a smart kid and we have recently started bonding over our love of cinema. He is a junior of the local Multimedia and Graphic Technology Secondary School with a motion picture specialisation. He plans on studying motion picture directing at the academy in two years time.\n\nWith his course set he set upon expanding his film education and he recently approached me with a list of movies he'd like to see. His favorite movie is Metropolis and he enjoys watching and talking about expresionist films. Of course his list includes other movies such as M, and I also suggested The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. \n\nHe also wants to see A Clockwork Orange and 2001, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Z (by Kosta Gavras) and \"some other films that are not as interesting\". As I was intrigued, I asked which films he was thinking of he volountered Sátántangó (which at 439 minutes he doesn't expect me to watch with him) and, oh yes, Salò.\n\nAnd I did not react well to news of Salò, as I don't think there is a benefit for a seventeen year old in seeing the movie. It was a deeply disturbing watch for me and I was in my forties, I don't really see how a kid his age would be equipped to even process the message of the film with sufficient life experience. I did not forbid him from seeing the movie, as that really doesn't achieve anything. I would like to help lay some ground work before he goes into it. I think that he should see Clockwork first. And I'd like some suggestions for other thematicaly similar films that would help him gradually ramp up the intensity for Salò. Should I hae him read someting beforehand? He is sufficiently aware of the Italian Social Republic, I am more concerned about psychological aspects of the story.\n\nOr should I just let him watch it cold and have a discussion about the depravity of the human condition later? I also don't feel this is a movie suitable to a father/son movie night but I'm also uneasy of havng him watch it alone.",

        "selftext": "in my opinion, one of the most tragic fictional villains of all time is cujo from the novel and movie cujo.\n\nfor starters, both works make it abundantly clear throughout that cujo is a very loving and good dog, like most saint bernards. but then, he gets bitten by a rabid bat and gets rabbies himself. and this prompts him to go crazy and start attacking people. if you think about it, the rampage and deaths aren't really cujo's fault and are a by product of a horrible degenerative disorder.\n\nthings get even sadder if you read the book. there are portions of the novel that take place from cujo's perspective. after he gets bitten, he's worried that his owners will be mad at him for getting bitten. but, as the story goes on and his psyche begins to crack, he starts to irrationally believe that his owners made him sick. not to mention that these portions make it extremely clear that cujo is in pain. not to mention, there's the final paragraph which is one of the saddest things i've ever read in any book. \"it would perhaps not be amiss to point out that he had always been a good dog. he had tried to do all the things his man and his woman and most of all his boy has asked or expected of him. he would have died for them if that had been required. he had never wanted to kill anybody. he had been struck by something. possibly destiny or fate or only a degenerative nerve disease called rabies. free will was not a factor.\"\n\nthere's also a part of the movie that adds to the tragedy. it happens after cujo has become rabid. he encounters the son of his owner brett. knowing that he's about to succumb to rabids, cujo uses the last bit of sanity that he has left to get away from brett before he can hurt him. my heart!\n\neven though cujo dies at the end of the story, there's a strong possibility that his suffering still hasn't ended. in king's 1991 novel needful things, the character of polly enters an abandoned house but is chased out by a malevolent ghost dog. a popular fan theory is that the house is the camber residence and the ghost dog is cujo's restless spirit. god damn it stephen king! stop being mean to cujo!",

        "selftext": "\n\nHi Everyone, \n\nI recently watched *The Notebook* and found myself grappling with some discomfort about the ending. So, I decided to write my own version, one that feels more poignant and bittersweet, yet complete. Here’s my version:\n\nInstead of Noah reading the story, it would be Lon. In my version, Allie chooses Lon, but her life with him isn’t entirely fulfilling—at least, not in her heart. She keeps a diary where she writes about how things could have been if she had chosen Noah instead. Her imagined life, where she paints, with Noah becomes her escape, a parallel world where her heart resides.\n\nYears later, as Allie begins to suffer from her illness, Lon finds the diary. Understanding how deeply she lived in her imagination, he decides to read her the diary—not as the story of their life, but as the life she dreamed of. Lon does this out of love, knowing it might bring her comfort and help her remember.\n\nOne day, as Lon reads, something shifts in Allie. She remembers her real life with Lon—their marriage, their children, and the life they built together. Overcome with guilt, she apologizes to him, admitting that while she always wanted to love him completely, part of her heart was always with Noah. Lon, being the loving and compassionate man he is, forgives her without hesitation.\n\nThen, Allie asks Lon about Noah. Lon tells her that Noah built a successful life, never married, and now owns a large mill, but is gravely ill. Touched by her lingering feelings, Lon promises to take her to see Noah the next day.\n\nBut fate intervenes. The next morning, they hear that Noah passed away during the night. When Allie and Lon visit his home, she is overcome with memories of their time there. The weight of her emotions becomes too much, and she quietly passes away, never to wake again.",

Her charcater Danielle isnt just eye candy...she’s confident but also vulnerable. Elisha makes you care about her journey and choices. She is the heart of the movie. \n\nTimothy Olyphant (Kelly).....Easily one of the coolest villains in any teen movie. He is both funny and intimidating. Every scene with him is a highlight.\n\nAlso have to call out Elis best friend \"Matthew\"... he is hilarious and chaotic. He brings so much energy to every scene, whether its his wild schemes or over-the-top reactions. Definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie.... especially when he gets interviewed in front of the college after his success \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ... Next\" at the end\n\nthe movie balances humor with some surprisingly emotional moments so well and it captures the early 2000s vibes in the best way possible. The soundtrack, the style, the overall feel. it really is a time capsule in the best way.\n\n\nRemember... the juice is worth the squeeze.",

It also serves as the great comeback of rom-com legend Maurice Chevalier and is often considered the last of the great MGM musicals.\n\nIn part 2, we look at somewhat more famous films such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the great religious epic The Seventh Seal, the 50s drive-in classic The Blob, a truly great Dracula adaptation and what is often considered Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.\n\nPart 1: [https://reviewosphere.blogspot.com/2024/11/oscars-retrospective-gigi-31st-academy.html](https://reviewosphere.blogspot.com/2024/11/oscars-retrospective-gigi-31st-academy.html)\n\nPart 2: [https://reviewosphere.blogspot.com/2024/11/oscars-retrospective-gigi-31st-academy\\_29.html](https://reviewosphere.blogspot.com/2024/11/oscars-retrospective-gigi-31st-academy_29.html)",

        "selftext": "night of the zoopocalypse\n\nclive barker and animation aren't two things that you would usually associate with each other. nevertheless, such a combination has come to pass with the end result being night of the zoopocalypse. executive produced by barker and based on a concept by him, the film takes place at a zoo that is hit by a meteor. eventually, a virus emerges from the meteor, turning most of the animal inhabitants into zombie like mutants. it's up to a small group of non infected animals to combat this threat. david harbour and gabbi kosmidis lead a cast that also includes kids in the hall alumni scott thompson and mandalorian alumni paul sun hyung lee. the film is set to release on march 7th.\n\ngrendel\n\njohn gardner's 1971 novel grendel tells the story of the titular monster before his confrontation with beowulf, the novel was acclaimed and is often considered to be one of the best novels of the 70s. and it seems that the jim henson company agrees as they will be producing a feature film adaptation. the film will be live action and will be directed by robert D krzykowski, who is most famous for the man who killed hitler and then bigfoot. academy award winner jeff bridges will voice the titular monster, dave bautista will play beowulf, and bryan cranson will play king hrothgar. given the involvement of the jim henson company, it's also highly likely that most, if not all, of the effects in the movie will be done practical and the monsters will be portrayed by puppets.\n\nhigh and low\n\nwhen it comes to remakes, spike lee doesn't have the best luck, if his remake of oldboy is anything to go off of. however, maybe he'll have better luck with his upcoming remake of akira kuroasawa's high and low. often considered to be one of kuroasawa's best movies, high and low tells the story of a businessman who is given a few hours to pay the ransom of his chauffeur's son's kidnapper. it seems like lee thinks that the movie is in need of a modern update since he has said that this remake will be his next project. lee will team up with denzel washington for the sixth time. the rest of the cast will include iifenesh hadera, jeffrey wright, ice spice, ASAP rocky, dean winters, michael potts, and john douglas thompson. while no concrete release date has been given, it is expected to arrive in the spring of 2025 and will be released theaterically before going onto apple tv+.\n\nthe long walk\n\nin addition to being one of the most famous authors ever, stephen king is often the most frequently adapted. his work has been adapted into movies, tv, and other forms. however, one novel of his that has yet to be adapted is the long walk. set in a dystopian america, the long walk focuses on an annual walking contest. however, as should be expected from a king penned story, things quickly go badly. the film adaptation will be directed by francis lawrence, who you may know from constantine, i am legend, and the hunger games sequels. cooper hoffman will lead a cast that includes the likes of charlie plummer, mark hamill, and judy greer. filming began in july of 2024 and ended in september. no offical release date has been given yet but, if post production goes smoothly, we could probably expect it at some point next year.\n\nthe lost bus\n\n\"A bus driver has to navigate a bus carrying children and their teacher to safety through the 2018 camp fire, which became the deadliest fire in California history.\" this is the wikipedia plot synopsis for paul greengrass's upcoming movie the lost bus. while a movie about a bus may not seem very interesting, a good storyteller can make any story interesting. matthew mcconaughey will star as kevin mccay, the driver of the titular bus. best supporting actress nominee america ferrera will also play a supporting role as mary ludwig, a schoolteacher. the film will be produced by both jason blum of blumhouse and jamie lee curtis. here's hoping that this movie stays in the right lane. \n\neddington\n\nari aster is one of the most unique directors currently working. despite only having 3 feature films to his name at the moment, he is quickly establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. and it seems that, in his newest film eddington, aster plans to take audiences to the wild west. directed, written, and co produced by aster, eddington will tell the story of a small town sheriff with high aspirations. after starring in aster's previous movie beau is afraid, academy award winner joaquin phoenix will reunite with the director. the supporting cast is nothing to sneer at as the film will star the likes of pedro pascal, emma stone, austin butler, luke grimes, deirdre o connell(an actress who is no stranger to bizzare movies), micheal ward, and clifton collins jr. the film is described as a black comedy.\n\nthe battle of baktan cross\n\nwhen it comes to paul thomas anderson, you never know what to expect. one minute, he's directing grand historical epics. the next, he's directing coming of age comedy dramas. and it seems that he's entering the crime genre with his newest film the battle of baktan cross. while there is no plot synopsis at the moment, the film is described as a crime drama thriller. leonardo dicaprio will lead a cast that includes regina hall, sean penn, alana haim, and benicio del toro. the film will also be anderson's first film to be released in IMAX. the battle of baktan cross will release on august 8th.\n\nwildwoods\n\nwildwoods will be laika studio's first film since 2019's missing link as well as the studio's first film of the 2020s. and while missing link was a pretty major departure from the studio's usual fare, wildwoods seems like it will be a return to form. described as a stop motion animated dark horror fantasy adventure film, wildwoods will tell the story two best friends who enter a magical forest after the girl's baby brother is kidnapped by cows. the film will star peyton elizabeth lee and jacob tremblay as the two leads. the supporting cast will consist of carey mulligan, mahershala ali, awkwafina, angela bassett, jake johnson, charlie day, jemaine clement, tom waits, and richard E grant. and that's just the talent in the cast. kubo and the two strings director travis knight will serve as director, reuniting with two strings composer dario marianelli. oscar nominated cinematographer caleb deschanel will make his animation debut as the film's cinematographer.\n\nthe phoenician scheme\n\nleave it to wes anderson to make espionage funny. his upcoming film the phoenician scheme is an espionage comedy drama that was written by anderson and roman coppola. though the plot is unknown at the moment, the film's cast is known and, par for the course for an anderson film, the cast is full of famous actors. benicio del toro, michael cera, bill murray, riz ahmed, tom hanks, benedict cumberbatch, scarlett johansson, rupert friend, willem dafoe, and bryan cranston. production began in march and ended in june.\n\nwake up dead man a knives out mystery\n\nknives out and glass onion were both very well recieved murder mystery stories and fans have been eager to see what benoit blanc would get up to next. well, next year, we may have our answer. the next film in the beniot blanc film series is entitled wake up dead man a knives out mystery. rian johnson will once again serve as writer and director with daniel craig once again playing everyone's favorite southern detective. and like the other films in the series, there is a stacked supporting cast. josh o connor, glenn close, josh brolin, mila kunis, jeremy renner, kerry washington, andrew scott, cailee spaeny, daryl mccormick, and thomas haden church. while the plot is unknown at the moment, if the previous two movies are anything to go by, it will be a compelling mystery that will inherently need to be rewatched.",

        "title": "I know I'm about 17 years too late, but 28 weeks later was an absolute dumpster fire of a zombie film. (Rant) (Spoilers)",
        "selftext": "\nJust to begin, I have had some heavy consideration after getting some comments that have changed my opinion about this movie.\n\nThis movie was not a “dumpster fire”. It was actually a pretty entertaining film that shows some new and also old ideas.\n\nI now believe that this movie was just a little underwhelming, considering it was a sequel to a great movie like 28 days later. If it was a movie of its own, then it would be a solid B tier movie, but it just can’t really live up to how 28 days later made me feel personally.\n\nAnd now, onto my heavily flawed rating on how this movie was.\n\n> Starting off, how was Don even allowed to enter his (ex) wife's holding area? (He left her to die so I consider that as divorce.)\nI know he has the \"all entry\" key card because of his status, but she is of EXTREME importance and danger. She should've only been allowed to be seen by scientists or guards.\n\n> Speaking of guards, why was NOBODY guarding her?\nShe is possibly one of the LAST infected humans on Earth, and she is left by herself. As shown in the movie, she caused another outbreak, and I bet if there was ONE guard in the room with her, none of this would've happened.\n\n> Why would the producers kill her off right then and there?\nShe was killed MINUTES after she was rescued, and it would been a better choice to see her tell her children what Don had done to her, and THEN she dies.\n\n> How did she survive the attack in the safe house anyway?\nThey don't just leave you alone if you are infected, as shown by Don, he literally murders her ON THE SPOT after seeing her. So if she was bitten in the safe house, they surely would've mad sure she had turned.\n\n> They gave absolutely NO warnings about the flashing lights, I'm just lucky I'm not epileptic. Gave me a terrible headache after though.\n\n> Why would you direct a crowd of people into what would basically be a slaughterhouse, and the LOCK them in there with NO guards and NO lights?\nNobody protected them, the majority of them were infected within a matter of minutes, and then the guards outside were basically a firing squad.\n\n> Why didn't Scarlet just say \"These children could lead to a cure.\" Or something instead of just stating her rank?\nI'm pretty sure if I was a guard and I heard that, I would just let her through.\n\n> Why does NOBODY have proper protection against bites/blood sprays?\nThey have had this infection for a whole 7 MONTHS and not a single person has proper protection against bites. If a normal person was in a zombie apocalypse, they would at least wrap magazines around their arms or something to protect themselves.\nIf somebody had worn a riot suit/armored hazmat suit, they would probably survive an attack.\n\n> Why didn't they just burn the entirety of Britan/surrounding infected areas to begin with?\nI'm pretty sure most life wouldn't survive being turned into ash, other than Dan somehow.\n\n> How did Dan even survive? I know we see him standing behind a building so he doesn't get charred, but there was fire coming from all directions.\n\n> I get it, nuking the city most likely wouldn't work, or would lead to Britan AND France/any surrounding countries being eradicated, but that's better than the possibility of that ENTIRE side of the globe being infected.\n\n> It has been less than a year, and people are already moving back into Britan. It hasn't even been full cleared yet, let alone the corpses even fully decomposing, and people are moving back in like it's nothing.\n\n> Why didn't Sergeant Doyle (Stupid haircut) tell General Stone (Helecopter man) that Andy (The literal only cure in existence) is able to stop all of this?\nThat would've stopped a lot of trouble.\n\n> Is it even possible to outrun a fireball??\n\n> How does one, nearly 180-200 lb man, make an entire helicopter go out of control just by grabbing the skids?\n\n> Furthermore, how did this idiot not get infected while all of those zombies were being blended into a person salad?\nHe was DRENCHED in blood head to toe, and it looked like he was still okay, but I may be wrong.\n\n> How did any of those infected survive being cut into peices? They can't survive a 5.56x45 round to the chest, but can be split in half and still try to crawl around? These are still humans we're talking about, even if they are infected. Humans usually don't survive being chopped in half.\n\n> If infected can be killed by gas, why didn't the military... I dunno... GAS THE ENTIRETY OF BRITAN FROM THE START? THAT WOULD SAVE A LOT MORE LIVES.\nAnd yes, I know what wind does to gas, but it could help if they even tried from the beginning.\n\n> A thin shirt does not save you from poisonous gas, just look at the soldiers from WW1-WW2 and you could guess how that would go. (When they were gassed in the trenches they had special masks drenched in special chemicals to counteract the gasses effects, any who didn't put these on could be dead in minutes, or suffer severe respiratory damage.) So a shirt probably won't stop much.\n\n> Why would you burn a clearly UNINFECTED man to death? At least have the decency to shoot him to death, then burn him.\n\n> I kinda get the helicopter shooting at their car, with the \"Kill all on sight order\" and all, but I don't think any infected can drive a car.\n\n> Why would you SCREAM into a dark building? Scarlet got killed because she was yelling. (Idk why I put this here tbh.)\n\n> The trope of \"I'm gonna jumpscare you when you turn back instead of just killing you when you're not paying attention.\" Is a little overused, but again, this movie came out in 2007.\n\n> It was terrifying seeing her be bashed to death with her own gun, but why haven't more infected done this sort of thing? That's showing higher brain function, and this could’ve been used more often. I guess Don being the only infected to use a weapon just adds to the shock value.\n\n> Why would Tammy just drop the gun after seeing her brother get bitten and therefore (presumably) infected?\n\n> Why would you leave your only form of defense? You don't know the next time you'll need a gun.\n\n> One does not just \"brush off\" being bitten in the throat, let alone a child. Like yeah, you can't turn into a zombie, but that doesn't mean you can't bleed out either.\n\nThis would’ve been better if it was not a sequel to such a great movie as its former.\nIn comparison, 28 days later was a much better movie imo, with much better storytelling and plot.\n\nI rebuke the title calling it a “dumpster fire” and it was more of just a let down.\n\nI’m sorry for the rant, I watched this movie at like 2 AM and it was right after watching 28 days later.",

        "selftext": "I've just finished this masterpiece and I'm still at awe, one of the best movies ever made, a perfect film. About it being an anti-war film, I don't think it is, and this doesn't mean anything in terms of quality, it is also not a moral judgement, I don't see a problem with it AT ALL, it's simply an observation about the movie's themes/message.\n\nSo first, what does it mean to be \"anti-war\", in my opinion it should deromanticize AND not condone war in any way, the former is done, the latter I don't think it is. The movie shows the barbarity of the nazi regime, every single nazi in the movie is absolutely disgusting and inhumane, while practically every soviet is an everyday person doing what is necessary to survive. The movie at no point questions any soviet policy during the war, in the movie they are justified at every point, even the boy robbing the cow can be sympathized and understood easily.\n\nAnd see, this is not a problem, we know the horrors of the nazi war machine, we know that 25million soviets died in WW2, they have every right to be pissed and to tell the story that way, which brings me to what I think is one of the main messages of the movie: **sometimes war can be justified.** The movie shows: \"the nazis are attacking us and it is either us or them\", what brought the end of the nazis? It was war, not pacifism or diplomacy, no, **war.** Particulary the USSR, we know they were the main protagonists in the defeat of the nazis, that's history, and the movie came out on the 40 year aniversary of the soviet victory. The movie ends with the soviets marching together towards nazi defeat. With the kid shooting Hitler's portrait. Even when they had the upper hand on the nazis they were pretty humane, considering the level of barbarity that was shown towards them throughout the movie, they quickly shot them and moved on, no sick games, no torture, etc. This is a very nationalistic and pro-soviet movie, and again this is not a moral judgement, this is not a flaw, it's just the story they chose to tell and it is a masterpiece.\n\nI think a truly anti-war movie should portrait war as something pointless and unnecessary from the pov of the everyday man like in Grave of the Fireflies. The war reflects on the kids as something that only harms them, they have no reason to engage in it, they don't understand it, it happened for the political/economic interests of the japanese empire. We know from history that Japan was more in the wrong than not and they were the agressors most of the time, so the movie shows this nihilistic perspective in which the war serves only to cause suffering even to japanese citizens and the kids die for nothing, they are not remembered, what happened during the film is absolutely pointless, as was the war. Another alternative would be to make a pro-peace movie, I like a quote from Coppola about it:\n\n>*But an anti-war film, I always thought, should be like The Burmese Harp – something filled with love and peace and tranquillity and happiness*\n\nps: I deleted the old post by mistake when trying the edit it, sorry",

        "title": "My Fascination with Alfred Hitchcock and My Top 5 Hitchcock Films",
        "selftext": "It was in the 1990s when I got my first VCR. I was beyond excited - just imagine, no more waiting for the cable guy to show you something good. Back then, there was no internet to help me figure out what to watch, so I headed to the local video store. I asked a friend who worked there that I wanted to watch an interesting mystery thriller and asked for suggestions. He told me to pick any Hitchcock movie - I couldnt go wrong. Thats when I was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nSince that day, Hitchcock has been one of my favorite directors. His mastery of suspense, mystery, and thriller genres is what makes him stand out. I think I’ve watched almost every Hitchcock film (at least the ones released after 1940), and each one has been a joy to revisit. Whats even more impressive is how well his movies have aged - something I can't say about a lot of films from that era. Hitchcock’s films have been remade and adapted countless times. Directors and writers still draw inspiration from his work. Even today!\n\nHere’s a list of my top 5 Hitchcock films. If you haven’t seen them, I highly recommend you do. It wasn’t an easy task narrowing it down because I love so many of his films, but these are my absolute favs.\n\n1. Psycho Psycho was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw. It was the first movie I saw on my new VCR. I’m not exaggerating when I say I got goosebumps during the final reveal. I literally jumped out of my chair, wondering what just happened. A fun fact: Psycho was the first movie ever made in the US to show a toilet flushing. Yep, you read that right - something as simple as a toilet became a big deal back then.\n2. Rebecca I’ve always loved the book by Daphne du Maurier, so when I heard Hitchcock adapted it into a film, I was both excited and a little skeptical. Typically, I’m not a fan of book-to-movie adaptations, but Hitchcock did an amazing job. The movie brings the eerie atmosphere of the novel to life, with strong performances and a perfect blend of tension and mystery. Highly recommend it.\n3. Rear Window Rear Window is an absolute masterpiece. Stewart and Kelly lead a stellar cast in this film, where Stewart plays a man stuck in a wheelchair, spying on his neighbors through the rear window. What he sees gets him tangled up in something far more sinister than he bargained for. The suspense is built slowly but steadily. What unfolds after is such a treat to watch. It’s been adapted and remade several times, with one of the most famous being Disturbia - not a bad film in itself but the original is much much better.\n4. Strangers on a Train This one really kept me guessing. The premise was intriguing - two men meet on a train, and one proposes a strange idea: if they each commit a murder for the other, they’ll be in the clear. It’s one of those thrillers that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering how it’ll all unfold. The film does a great job of playing with psychological tension and moral dilemmas.\n5. Dial M for Murder I saw Dial M for Murder a little later in my Hitchcock journey. Actually, I watched The Perfect Murder, a remake starring Michael Douglas, before I saw this. While I thought the remake had a decent plot, it didn’t quite measure up. Then, I read somewhere that it was copied from a Hitchcock movie - Dial M for Murder. I saw it and absolutely loved it. The plot was similar with some differences, but the execution was so much better. It was a fun, thrilling watch that had me hooked from start to finish.\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention some of my other favorite Hitchcock films, like Birds, Rope, Notorious, Spellbound, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. These could easily make a top-five list on another day.\n\nIf you haven’t seen his work and like watching movies, I suggest you watch his work. You won’t regret it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ig64435udz3e1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d96e3d48d789f66746fef3ad681b4a11a975a669\n\n",

He is a worried father, and even when they were in the restaurant (which I can understand why Kim wouldn't understand, she young and really wants to go), Lenore was acting like his concerns weren't valid. Then when he find out she was lying, she still acts like he is insane and paranoid. It just really bothers.

        "title": "Was Inception About Coping With Dementia and Grief? ",
        "selftext": "Would love to get the community's perspective on a different angle on Inception. \n\nThere was this recurring quote in the movie from both Cobb and Mal throughout the movie: \n\n\"You're waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you when the train will take you, cuz you'll be together.\"\n\nWhat if the movie is really about a failed suicide pact and dementia? \n\nI think the whole sequence from 2:12:45 to 2:13:50 redefines the whole movie.  This is the final scene with Mal after the kick is underway where Cobb reminds Mal that they had already grown old together and we see older versions of them walking in a city holding hands (with wedding rings) and then seeing the hands clasped together and rumbling on what looks like train tracks (with wedding rings, but you have to zoom in).  We know from Nolan that any scenes with the wedding ring was real life.\n\nTwo big prevailing themes in the movie centers on \"an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone\" (2:16:03) and taking a leap of faith.   Perhaps old Mal had dementia (in the above sequence Cobb tells Mal that she doesn't remember) and perhaps they planned a suicide by train (old hands on the train tracks) and he couldn't take the leap of faith and left her on the tracks at the last second leaving Cobbs now an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone and the movie reflects his reconciliation and grief.   Perhaps the whole movie is a dream of old Cobb sedated while in hospice but that's just my speculation.  Mal kinda pokes at the fourth wall a bit in the sequence from 1:59:59 to 2:00:51 which highlights how everything in the plot had conveniently come together so nothing is real.\n",

        "title": "Rebel Ridge is a damn good thriller - reminiscent of a modern-day 'Rambo'",
        "selftext": "Just caught Jeremy Saulnier's newest flick, Rebel Ridge, on Netflix. I'm a big fan of his, and consider Blue Ruin and Green Room to be 2 of the best thrillers in the last 10-15 years. Hold the Dark was just ok but I was still excited to check this one, since I love the first Rambo and this seemed to be in the mold of that classic \"stoic badass strolls into small town and gets into it with corrupt lawmen\" narrative. \n\nThis is a much more restrained, and lower-key movie than the trailers make it seem. It's really more of a slow burn thriller as opposed to an action movie, and it does an amazing job of slowly building the suspense and elevating the stakes so that whenever the rare action scenes do pop up, they feel like they have impact and meaning. \n\nThe film is carried hard by Aaron Pierre, and his performance is honestly enough to justify watching it. I've never seen him in anything before but after this, I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye on any future projects (I know he's going to John Stewart in the Lanterns show, which I'm pretty hyped about). He has movie star levels of presence and charisma and most importantly, he is built like a fucking *tank* and completely sells the badass ex-Marine character who can kick anyone's ass around him. \n\nWhat I loved about how the movie approached the narrative is that Terry is constantly trying to defuse the situation. This isn't some Dwayne Johnson action blockbuster or John Wick power fantasy where the hero just demolishes everyone without any effort. Terry consciously goes out of his way to avoid violence - loved the little touches where he unloads guns in tense situations. It's just too bad that these fools keep asking for it, so when he has  no choice but to put a beatdown of these corrupt asshole cops, it's immensely satisfying. The action scenes are really well done, keeping the fight choreography grounded and realistic, showing how Terry uses his technique and size to quickly put guys down.\n\nThe story felt pretty timely too, dealing with asset forfeiture laws, and Don Johnson and Emory Cohen are both great as the primary antagonists. Nice supporting turns from AnnaSophia Robb and David Denman as well.\n\nThis is the kind of thriller I feel like we don't get much of anymore, one that feels refreshingly adult, grounded and keeping the stakes personal and intimate. Highly recommend.",

After watching both of those, I’m extremely disappointed. Nope was painful to get through with no plot conclusions and nothing making any reasonable interest. I don’t mind Science Fiction and maybe I just don’t like the genre, but I feel like nope was the biggest waste of time I’ve ever spent. It was not interesting, there were no a-ha moments and I was overall really disappointed. I watched us which I thought was better than nope, but still nowhere near the quality and genius of get out. I really hope this isn’t his one hit wonder, because I need more movies like get out. Is this an insane theory?",

Based on a true story of a prison break. Really gritty. Starring top actors giving some incredible performances, Benicio del Toro, Patricia Arquette and Paul Dano. The scenes are all so captivating. Just a really well put together show all round. \n\nThen of course, there's Severance. Just stupendous, a real fine wine of a tv show. Gloriously quirky and compelling. Great to see Adam Scott beng given something more meaty to work with. He's such a great straight comic actor that it makes perfect sense he could play such a nuanced, thoughtful character. Plus, it's just such a great ensemble drama. \n\nStiller's projects seem to all have a real subtext, and you see that in most scenes.\n\nMy points on these shows is that Stiller clearly can unlock special abilities in his actors to really explore a scene, a feeling or a premise and give it so much more depth\n\nThese are all really interesting performances and fascinating projects. \n\nI think as long as Severance doesn't continue to take hellishly long and wraps up after an appropriate amount of seasons, Stiller could go on to make a few more really renowned dramatic films or tv shows.\n\nPlus, he has an impressive back catalogue of directing credits on more comedic movies, dating back to the 90s. Including The Cable Guy, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. You don't make these great comedy movies without having incredible directing chops.\n\nI think Stiller could pull a Clint Eastwood and Jordan Peele on us and redefine his career.",

The former nurse takes care of him in her remote house, but becomes irate when she discovers that the author has killed Misery off in his latest book. Annie keeps Sheldon prisoner while forcing him to write a book that brings Misery back to life.\n\n**REVIEW:** It's simply brilliant! One of the finest psychological horror films I have ever seen, very much in the league of classics like Psycho and The Shining. Kathy Bates is simply awesome! Must must watch if you are a psychological thriller fan.",

        "selftext": "While seeing this film I noticed small bits of things I tend to do that correlated with Benji (Kieran Culkin's) behavior. Just like Benji I am very extroverted and a happy person in general, but there are moments when certain things or situations just get to me very deeply and I get very emotional. I'm hypersensitive which means I enjoy life to the fullest and is grateful for the little things in life but I can also get sad for the littlest things which makes me suffer unconditionally. I've never met or seen anyone like me until I saw this movie. I was evaluating every single person's reaction to Benji's way of being, non of them wanted to be near him since the risk of him having a tantrum or having an emotional burst...This made me realize why I don't have any close friends or people around me, seeing the movie made me realize that if I had a benji I wouldn't wanna be near him or myself with the fear that they could hurt me in emotional and mental ways; being there for those types of people is very draining. They tend to be very negative towards themselves and feel like they don't deserve certain things. These negative feelings toward themselves makes them jealous of everyone since they feel like they aren't capable of deserving true love and real happiness. I am writing this description based on the things I saw he does in the movie as well as what correlates with me. I've been reading reviews like crazy to find a diagnoses because he has the same issues as me. He was diagnosed with bipolar disease and took medications but I've been told I don't have bipolar and would never take meds to solve a mental or emotional issue. I've been in a personal journey to help myself since my mother told me she prefers to protect herself from me since it's very tiring to be near me. The good times are amazing but she says she senses evil and negativity just as if I wanted to ruin a good time and have everyone focus on myself. I struggle with self-destruction tendencies since I was a kid and a part of me  thinks I do this because I feel like I'm not good enough and all the overthinking gets together and makes me burst with emotions or doing something to hurt myself or others just so I could stay alone and suffer. I think benji and I just both struggle with self-destruction tendencies. My psychologist told me that my personal self-love journey is going to help a lot and I won't be able to let other people love me until I learn to love myself. Personally I'm very happy that I've become self aware of all the people i've hurt in my life but most importantly myself, I'm glad I finally made the choice to help myself and stop being the victim. I'm a bit nervous because I've never been to truly love myself even after 22 years, I've always been quite negative about my body and even if I fix something it's never good enough, I just need to love who I am and I'm sure I can get through it with the right professional help.",

Pretty much every line in that film is God-Tier quotable.\n\nSome films only have a few Quotables but they're just as epic. Aliens for example has \"they mostly come out at night\" and \"game over, man!\" which are both gold.\n\nThe great comedies are masterpieces of Quotables.  Airplane! and Hot Fuzz in particular (along with the already-mentioned Lebowski) are packed with incredibly awesome Quotables.\n\nBut what happened to cinema?  These days you barely even get a single great Quotable even in good movies.  I loved both the new Dune films, but I can't think of a single good quotable in either one.  \"I love you 3000\" is an ass-tier quotable.  \"On your left\" like that's not even fun, what else has Marvel even got?  \"I am Iron Man\" I guess but that movie is now 14 years old and the first one they made, and back when films still came with quotables.\n\nI think we need to do something, write letters to the studios maybe or holler at James Gunn on twitterX.  Great one-liners are an important part of the moviegoing experience but nobody drops them anymore it seems.\n\nDoes this even make sense to anyone else?l or dod I just eat too much turkey yesterday and the tryptophan is still messing with my mind?

In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 36: Poland - Krótki film o zabijaniu (engl.: A Short Film About Killing)\n\n>Day 35: Norway - Flåklypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n>Day 34: North Macedonia - Нема да бидеш сама (engl.: You Won’t Be Alone)\n\n>Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n>Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n>Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n>Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n>Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n>Day 28: Luxembourg - Läif a Séil (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n>Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Kriminālās ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)5",

        "title": "An Observation about the Sixth Sense 25 Years Later",
        "selftext": "Yadda, yadda, spoilers.\n\nWhen Sixth Sense was released it looked like a generic ghost story movie which I had no interest in until a friend, whose opinion I respected, told me I **had** to see it, but wouldn't tell me why. I would bet that a number of other people at that time had something like a similar experience; either they heard from a friend or read some reviews or just saw the box office numbers and realized this movie had something going for it. So I went with a few other friends and we were blown away by the ending, naturally. Recently, I remembered the conversation we had immediately following the movie and I recalled that all of us said the same thing: just before the ending, we thought it was a fine film, but didn't see what the big deal was –and *then* we saw the twist and were just as thrilled as everyone else.\n\nAnd that recollection made me realize something either truly ingenious about Shyamalan or that he just got incredibly lucky. Take your pick.\n\nThat is: up until the end, it's not really that great of a film at all. I mean, it's fine. A few good jump scares, definitely some creepy scenes, but without *that* ending, the film is a C+ or maybe a B. However, preceding that awesome twist with a just an okay film completely misdirects the audience into thinking this is, in fact, just a mediocre picture. But then when the twist happens and we're all blown away. It's the basically the \"Yeah, I'm not doing anything; don't worry about it, everything is just normal\" misdirection that magicians use all the time and, like in a good magic ~~trick~~ illusion, lulling or even boring the audience into thinking they know what's going to happen is makes what actually does happen all the more amazing.\n\nSo maybe Shyamalan made what he thought would have been a great ghost story all along, but just got really, really lucky that he thought of a really great ending. Or maybe he intentionally kept the first half fairly low-key/stakes to stun us at the end.\n\nTake your pick.",

I also find there is often low production values depicted in most of his films which is rather embarrassing. Its not like his drama's like A Fall from Grace are any better. I honestly think Michael Bay is a better director overall than he is. Your thoughts on this man's work?",

Nolan never showed us the top falling over which I understand was to keep the audiences guessing but…\n\n2. Every time Leo sees his kids in his mind in his dreams throughout the movie, they are wearing the exact same clothes. Which means he is remembering a memory of them. At the end of the movie when he comes back to his kids, they are wearing the same. fucking. clothes. And they haven’t aged at all. \n\nAnyway that’s where I’m leaning now - he’s still dreaming. \n\nEdit: I’m loving the discussions! After reading all your comments I appear to be wrong - Leo’s kids in the end were not wearing the exact same clothes. Check out the [Differences in clothing](https://images.app.goo.gl/EJ4dezvGqa6Uxgf8A) that I found by googling it. I seemed to have gotten ahead of myself on this one. \n\nI’ve also heard about the wedding ring being a totem, which I can totally agree with. \n\nI will say this - after reading the discussions, I started thinking about the wife died in the movie. She died by falling off a ledge. Gravity took her down. Gravity was also a big component/the kick to wake the team up at the end. So now I’m even more curious! Is Leo dreaming because he still has not experienced his gravity drop in “the real world.” Hmmm 🤔 ",

Basically, the idea of ​​someone fucking a cake could have made you laugh, but it wasn't realized like that at all, and this applies to all the \"comical\" scenes in the film. Many have told me that if I had watched them when they came out they would have made me laugh more, maybe that's true, but it's not a justification because many films released more or less in those years or even older make me laugh a lot, so, well, tell me your opinion",

        "selftext": "[translated from Yle news:](https://yle.fi/a/74-20127817)\n\nThe story of the most famous sniper of the Winter War has never before been brought to the silver screen.\n\nThe Russians gave Häyhä the name \"White Death\" — and for good reason.\n\nAccording to his personal notebook, Häyhä killed 542 Russian soldiers during the 98 days of the Winter War. This is more than any other sniper in the world has achieved in such a short time.\n\nThe movie is set during the winter of 1939-1940 on the Kollaa front, where a small group of Finns stood to stop an overwhelmingly superior enemy from invading Finland.\n\nHäyhä was seriously wounded in the battles at Kollaa just a week before the end of the Winter War. He awoke from a coma on the day the war ended.\n\nDue to his injuries, Häyhä was unable to take part in the Continuation War, though he would have wanted to.\n\nSimo Häyhä was born in 1905 in Rautjärvi, Karelia, and passed away as a respected war hero in a veterans' care home in Hamina in 2002.\n\nThe film's consultant is Major (ret.) Tapio Saarelainen, who has authored several books about Häyhä.\n\n[more news details](https://www.screendaily.com/news/finnish-film-h%C3%A4yh%C3%A4-about-the-white-death-sniper-in-the-works-exclusive/5199577.article)",

It’s fascinating to consider who truly stands out as the most versatile. Personally, I believe Robin Williams is the greatest actor to have ever graced the screen. In my opinion, he mastered every genre—horror, thriller, comedy, drama, family films, and animation—effortlessly. His ability to fully embody such a wide range of characters, each with depth and authenticity, is unmatched. Would love peoples opinions. ",

To celebrate and profit on that, the distributor chose to release the movie with a special edition, that includes the theatrical cut, the extended cut, special features and 44 booklet pages of information about the creation of the movie. \n\nSo I wanted to know from you: how is this sub's opinion on Rambo 4? And would you say Rambo 1-3 are worth it? Do I need them to understand Rambo 4 or the Rambo character in general? \n\nWhat gets me interested in Rambo 4 is: Stallone wrote, directed and lead it. It's a project full of his passion. \n\nEdit: so many helpful answers and interesting discussions have spawned here over the past hours. Thank you to all of you!",

I don't really count when there's a movie that adapts a book, but also has a movie.  As an example mirror mirror is the best snow white and seven dwarfs movie in my opinion, but it isn't trying to adapt the 1930's animated movie to live action, it's simply adapting the original fairy tale.

I really want to promote it in my own way as I doubt it'll get too much mainstream attention. \n\nWhile it'll never be on any lists of greatest movies or anything, well maybe on a list of \"best movies about a disability/disabled person\", but it more than succeeds at what it aims to achieve. I admit I watched it because of a personal connection, I have cerebral palsy, just like the main character, and have only seen one other film about my condition before *My Left Foot*. I was very happy to see that another film about my disability has been made, and with an actor that actually understands the condition fully too, that didn't just patronise and seek to show us as weak and pitiful. \n\nAnyway, the film was great. It succeeded in providing an insight into the condition from both the disabled individual's perspective as well as the carer's perspective. All of the actors were believable and elicited genuine reactions from me as the viewer. It reminded me of the discriminations I suffered at that age but also the times that I was lucky (and continue to be lucky) to have good people in my corner to support me. \n\nThe greatest praise should be reserved for the lead actress, Phoebe-Rae Taylor, who is a genuinely great actor. Especially for a 12-13 year old making her acting debut, even though you could argue that she is playing a character that she has a unique insight about and wasn't always acting in the traditional sense, as she has cerebral palsy herself. She shines in this movie, showing the highs and lows of living with this disability, and reminding me of things (both positive and negative) that I hadn't thought of in years. It also reminded me that the frustrations I live with on a daily basis, and can feel immensely guilty for, are normal.\n\nI really encourage everyone to watch this film. Even if you don't have a disability yourself, or have any connection to someone that does, it is a great movie. It will show you how, and how not to, act around someone that has a disability. Even I learned something, it highlighted to me the impact of my own ableism, (be it self-hatred and/or external reaction to those I perceive as \"more disabled\"), that I have recognised before but not as obviously as I could while watching this film.\n\nI hope that, if you are able to watch this film, you enjoy it. It is bittersweet, and the last half hour or so was genuinely heartbreaking to me, but it is an important film that I'm happy to have experienced. ",

About 3/4s of the way through, he turned to me and sinply said \"i forgot we were watching a movie, what has happened?\" I couldnt answer him because I wasn't paying attention to the movie despite watching it.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes - Saw this as a double feature. It was the second movie in line so that could have had an impact. However, it was just bland in my opinion.

        "title": "I watched 365 movies this year, and here is what I learned. ",
        "selftext": "I decided back in January that I wanted to try to stop doom scrolling. And instead of scrolling for 2 hours I would watch a movie instead. Over the course of the month I decided to try to watch the equivalent of one movie a day all year. Well, I finished early and I learned 3 things. \n\n1: People are in entirely too many movies.  I know actors gotta eat, but man, I saw so much cross over from actors in the last 10 years. It got so bad that I started recognizing people who weren’t even IN other movies. \n\n2: You can really tell when a movie has a budget. Watching primary low-mid budget horror movies, you can really tell the difference when a movie has a bit of money to make everything look good. \n\n3: If your movie isn’t 2 hours then it only needs to be an hour and a half. None of this 1:45 nonsense. Either pad it out to 2 hours or ideally, cut it down to a buck thirty.  Especially (not Sexually! lol)  if you are making a horror movie. \n\nCouple of facts: \n\nFirst movie I watched: Cube 2: hypercube\n\nLast movie: Planes trains and automobiles. \n\nBest movie: American Fiction \n\nWorst Movie: The Creeps.  \n\nMovies I watched that I had seen before: 16\n\nMost movies watched in a single day: 5\n\n\nIt’s been a long year and I’ve enjoyed having something else to focus on.  Hope this finds you well, and watch more movies. \n\nEdit: sexually lol \n\nAs requested Top 10: \n\n1: American Fiction\n\n2: biosphere \n\n3: They Cloned Tyrone \n\n4: 1917\n\n5: Maxxxine \n\n6: the Blackening\n\n7: the vast of night \n\n8: The green knight \n\n9: bottoms \n\n10: Shadow in the cloud (seriously I dare you not to love this)\n\n\nEdit 2: people have a lot of opinions about movies, yet it seems mine are the only ones that are invalid? \n\nThere are a ton of other things I learned from watching so many movies in such a short time. I, however, typically like to enjoy things more than shit on them (I.e. the beautiful madness that is Shadow in the Clouds). \n\nSo allow me to clarify what in reverse:\n\n3: In regards to run time, yes I agree, a story is as long as it needs to be, but streaming places like Netflix don’t usually care,  because they want a longer movie that keeps you watching. This can kill whatever story they were trying to tell. This is less a problem with Older movies, and more a modern issue and issue with a lot of horror movies (which is 80% what I watched).  It was my way of saying that movies could be tightened up to be more impactful and memorable.  For the “movies should be as long as they need to tell the story” people, we all know if movies needed to be as long as they need to be then there wouldn’t be a need for an editor nor “directors cuts.” Some stories don’t need the time and some stories need more. \n\n2: of course movies have different budgets, I am saying it is VERY noticeable when you go back to back and see a difference. It is amazing what people can do on a smaller budget to make it look good and how a larger budget production can blow the money and you don’t ever really see it on the screen.  \n\n1: so many faces end up looking the same. Admittedly I come from an era where there were big names in the theaters and someone being in a movie meant something. Not something GOOD necessarily but something.  With this last year, I would see movies with an actor in it and still not know what sort of movie it is. You see “Justin Long” is in a horror movie and you know you are basically in for a good time. You see someone like Gerald Farlong in a movie and you just wanna know if you should know him from something (you shouldn’t. I made him up).  I do like that Square jaw man from the Hit Man tho. \n\nIf I learned anything real, it’s that I love movies, and even if a movie is bad, as long as it’s fun, then it didn’t waste my time. \n\nGlad you all love American fiction and vast of night.  \n\nGlad you all hate American fiction and the green knight. \n\nI’m gonna go watch “It’s a wonderful knife” now. \n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I always thought I didn’t like horror movies. I usually don’t enjoy blood, violence, or scenes designed to disgust. But recently, I watched Hereditary by Ari Aster, which is categorized as a horror movie, and for a change—not only was I not grossed out or anything—I genuinely enjoyed it! There were plenty of scary scenes that made me grab onto whoever was sitting next to me xD, but it was the kind of fear that’s fun and intriguing—I loved being scared.\n\nThe casting was excellent. The acting of the mother (Annie) was fantastic, and the choice of Milly Shapiro for the role of the daughter (Charlie) was spot-on, and so on.\n\nThe film's atmosphere was mesmerizing; for example, the fact that the mother was a \"miniaturist\" and recreated their home in miniature—it was simply brilliant! It didn’t necessarily add anything significant to the plot, but it contributed something very unique to the movie's vibe.\n\nThe scary parts were genuinely frightening, in my opinion, but what was special is that along with my fear, I also found myself laughing.\nThe amazing director edited the film in such a fantastic way that even in the scary scenes, there was a sense of humor. This movie is truly one of a kind.\n\nIn conclusion: Ari Aster, the crown is yours! 👑\n\n",

        "selftext": "So I was looking at [this list of movies ordered by most box office admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_by_box_office_admissions) and I noticed all the top ones are Chinese. At first I figured \"big population, makes sense\" but then I noticed that they're *all* from 1979 to 1985. What's up with that? There are FOUR movies from 1980 alone that had more box office admissions than Titanic (the largest non-Chinese movie in terms of box office admissions). The idea of that many movies from the *same* year being that big is insane to me. What was going on during this period?\n\nI tried asking some Chinese friends of mine, and while they recognized some of the movies, they weren't really sure why it only lasted during this 6 year timeframe. One suggested that the Tiananmen Square incident could've brought an end to it, but that was in 1989, which would still leave an unexplained 4 year gap. I wasn't sure if I should ask this here, r/AskHistorians, or some other sub, but if anyone has any ideas, let me know.\n\nI also noticed a surprising lack of Indian movies, given the reputation of Bollywood and size of India. If population were the sole reason, I would figure India would also take several of the top spots on that list.",

Some consultants and actors of American Me were mudered by the Mexican Mafia (source: Danny Trejo's biography). \n\nIn Shot caller they used PENI (Public Enemy Number 1), NLR (Nazi Low Riders) and, The Brand (Aryan Brotherhood).  When one of the writers of the movie was doing research for Shot Caller, he posed as a Parole Officer in training when visiting the prisons.  That leads me to believe that they did not get those gangs' permission to use their names. But I'm not absolutely sure.  If they didn't, it's a dangerous thing to do.

All I ask is that you stick to the following two rules: \n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n>Day 35: Norway - Flåklypa Grand Prix (engl.: Pinchcliffe Grand Prix)\n\n>Day 34: North Macedonia - Нема да бидеш сама (engl.: You Won’t Be Alone)\n\n>Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n>Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n>Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n>Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n>Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n>Day 28: Luxembourg - Läif a Séil (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n>Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Kriminālās ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

There's something about how the music is connected to a storyline that makes it powerful for me, for example:\n\n\"Elizabeth\" (Elgar's Nimrod, Mozart's Requiem in D Minor)\n\n\"V for Vendetta\" (Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture)\n\n\"The King's Speech\" (Beethoven's Symphony #7)\n\n\"Wit\" (Arvo Part's Spiegel im Spiegel)\n\nIs there anything that you might suggest I look into adding to this list? Something that you feel was employed really well in cinema?\n\n(For what it's worth, I started looking into this after compiling a list of some scores composed specifically for film, by the likes of John Barry, Dario Marianelli, Howard Shore, Williams etc..).\n\nAlso, I think I initially got reeled in (ha, pardon the pun) after viewing this video essay on how Shore approached the Lord of The Rings score:\n\n\"How Music Elevates Story\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e7BkmF8CJpQ?si=eiYbn8O3Vc4dVZfD\n\nIf there are any recommendations for other YouTube channels that may do similarly accessible video essays on classical pieces, I'd love to take a look at them!!\n\nMuch obliged!",

Obviously, every artist imbues a part of themselves and draws inspiration from their own experiences in whatever they make, regardless of if it's a realistic, domestic situation or a big action fantasy. But it always is interesting when you see films that are clearly drawn from past experiences and how that knowledge of pain and joy can help appreciate a film more.\n\nSure some may see it as being self-indulgent but some of the best movies of all time have been grown-up, mature directors looking at their lives.\n\nAnd to be clear, it doesn't just have to be their adolescense/childhood. \n\nAntonio Banderas had to embody a dramatized adult Pedro Almodóvar reflecting on his path in life. All That Jazz looked at Fosse's career as a dancer, choreographer, and director. Celine Song has said Past Lives was inspired by a real childhood friendship she had prior to moving abroad and their reunion after she'd gotten married. Noah Baumbach has not been afraid of sayig how Marriage Story was inspired by the divorce between he and Jennifer Jason Leigh. And while not one character served as an exact mirror, Platoon was reinforced by Oliver Stone's real life experiences as a Vietnam veteran.\n\nSo what directors do would you like to see make a semi-autobiographical film about their own lives? I also want to put an addendum that **you can include directors who are sadly no longer with us and directors who are currently \"retired\"**",

        "selftext": "This question from having watched the Conclave feature commentary. It was terrific and informative, for me. I love feature commentaries (Emerald Fennell’s for Promising Young Woman and Rian Johnson’s for Knives Out, to mention only two). Here, the director of Conclave clearly admires his actors and crew so much. Yet I thought at moments he was maybe a little too free with the comments about some of the actors: their disagreements over, for example, the costumes (whether they should have been actually what a cardinal would wear or not, etc.). Mostly Tucci and Fiennes. He mentions that Stanley Tucci had doubts about his performance near the end of the shoot, which I am sure is common. From the sound of things, Tucci in real life would probably say, “it’s fine\" (listen to the commentary;-)). Ralph Fiennes apparently was a bit piqued about his costume, because an actual member of the church showed him a costume detail, and Fiennes wondered why Berger wouldn't use it. It’s very here and there. It does NOT sound like the set of an Xmen movie, truly. This director, a wonderful filmmaker, sounds like a very decent and knowledgeable man who truly appreciated his cast and crew. Still, does anyone know if actors or crew members can prescreen these, and give their approval or veto to certain parts? ",

        "selftext": "Godfather 2 is generally recognized as an all-time classic as it was nominated and won numerous Oscars and featured some outstanding performances. It's also one of my own favorite movies but I have one problem with it and I think I'm not alone. In short it's Michael's body guard. You know, the guy who wore an all black suit, black hat and black turtleneck while visvisiting Miami and Havana? He mostly stands in the background trying to look menacing but his advanced age and slow ambulation just made me think Hyman Roth could easily just walk away from him even with his heart condition. It's strongly implied that this man in black is a highly accomplished hitman/bodyguard given that Michael entrusts his own security to this one geriatric, zoombified stiff. But when it's time for him to shine, when he gets the call to show us what he's got he fails oh so miserably it's cringe worthy. First, when he takes out Johnny Ola he chooses for his weapon a wooden clothes hanger, never mind that even mild pressure on the cross bar will cause structural failure, but during the scene he loses his left hand grip on the hanger thus losing any leverage he may have conceivably had. Yet, Johnny drops into unconsciousness pretty damn quick, talk about being soft for a gangster. The man in black follows this up by following Roth to a hospital where he takes his sweet time to secure the room before making his move on the  utterly defenseless Roth. Does he pull a gun? No. A knife? No. A blunt object? No. Instead he opts for what looks like the kind of pillow you would get on a Jet Blue flight. His final act of pure incompetance is holding said pillow in a futile defensive act when police burst into the room underscore that this guy was completely unqualified to be a professional hit man. That sums up my complaint, and I understand that some will disagree with my assessment because he's part of one of the greatest films of all time but if you defend the man in black, you are just plain wrong and need to go back stream the film and you will be convinced that he was just plain lame. Thank you for your time.",

The guy still had a very good career but just not what I would have [envisioned](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F13AqgLCro0IB8s%2Fgiphy.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=0c38bbc0aa796c39a8c7d7117f5b7e3e6f7d2c52036283a04610f22e3ac3c0df&ipo=images). \n* What the fuck happened with [Joey Lauren Adams](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fcmiwb8mbnjfb1.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=999bbd91eb217bc1b153773152f862acbe89f9b40b13f743a2e8f856ac9d1591&ipo=images)?

Honestly, go watch Chasing Amy. If she had Renee Zellweger's brand name she would have been nominated for a damn Oscar.\n* I feel Kevin Smith, in general, doesn't get enough credit for these first 5 movies. I know he has an outsized personality and presence now compared to most of these movies, but don't let that color your perceptions of these movies. They are just hilarious movies. \n* Off off topic - This is also how I feel about John Cusack. I have no clue how that guy wasn't a bigger deal.

Also...Peak [Mimi Driver](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.quotesgram.com%2Fimg%2F95%2F13%2F1096231984-702-Grosse-Pointe-Blank-quotes.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=8cfe346a90e6d50e940ca75ca11730f9ad652877fbf7587d05a2def7391ac6b3&ipo=images). It's insane...maybe I'll do that movie next...\n* I think Mallrats is Peak Peak [Shannon Doherty](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic1.cbrimages.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2Fmallrats-cast.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=f69e5a77f35a677601886bc1687afa60ea880526a059c0224ce751427ff8f63c&ipo=images). This is my favorite thing she's ever done. And probably had an outsized impact on my taste in women. I appreciate when a chick will just say \"Get your shit together you fucking dumbass.\"\n* Also, I made it this entire time without even mentioning Dogma. Unfortunately, I would get entirely sidetracked by that movie. It's fucking awesome. But, unless you break the law you can't even watch it. Though, I think that's about to change due to Harvey Weinstein being a piece of shit. But with less money than before.\n\nAll that being Said, Kevin Smith is like The Farrelly Brothers meets Wes Anderson.\n\nAlso - **Aflleck was the bomb in [Phantoms](https://i.gifer.com/JnoO.gif)**",

Please let me know if I missed something amazing.\n\nAnd I'm really surprised I haven't heard of any new animal attack movies because I *really* try to keep my ears open for these. The most recent one I saw was Loop Track, but I'm hoping you all know of some hidden gems I can devour.\n\nEDIT: I forgot Alien: Romulus",

Brando delivers one of his best performances as Terry,  the younger brother of the criminal union boss, conflicted by having delivered another co-worker to his mob execution. Karl Malden plays the very earnest local priest using his church to persuade the workers to resist their criminal union leaders  \n\nIn her screen debut, Eva Marie Saint was impressive as the murder victim's sister Edie, and love interest for Terry. Eva Marie Saint turned 100 this year",

To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out why an Australian filmmaker made a movie with a plot set in North Macedonia, but maybe I'll get back to this as soon as I've found out more (after the viewing).\n\nBut what I would like to find out very quickly is your favorite movie set in **Norway**. I think this time a movie that is genuinely from the country itself could end up on [our official letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) list again, but we'll see... The only thing I'm setting here are just two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 34: North Macedonia - You Won’t Be Alone\n\n>Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n>Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n>Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n>Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n>Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n>Day 28: Luxembourg - Läif a Séil (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n>Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Kriminālās ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)\n\n>\n\n>",

        "selftext": "I'm not too deeply familiar and have a surface-level understanding of American film industry based on what I've read so far. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIf I understood correctly, American film industry is more focused on making money with mainstream mass audience over artistic cinema films like Martin Scorsese.\n\nMeanwhile, in France (I'm not sure about other European countries) their film industry is the opposite: it focused more on artistic cinema output rather than making money with mass audience. Creators get funding for making artistic films that doesn't focus on box office performance while in the USA, it's the opposite of this. Films that doesn't guarantee box office performance will not get funding from major film industry.\n\nNow that is out of the way, I have an idea: why not have space for both, mainstream blockbuster and artistic cinema films to be made? Why in USA only the former is prioritised while the latter is neglected? I think having both types of films get to be made is the best compromise. Yes, blockbuster franchise can get funded, but have space for artistic films to be incentivised and funded as well. It shouldn't be zero-sum.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

They keep circling around the main complaint they do have but they don't don't want to be un-PC about it. Mescal is definitely a brilliant actor, making inroads in his career, but compared to Russell Crowe in Gladiator, he's just not delivering a testosterone-heavy performance. It wouldn't be a problem if the film didn't make it a point to compare Lucius with Maximus or having Lucius act like a macho beast when the first thought in one's head is how \"snatched\" Lucius' waist is. \n\nThe fact that Lucius started out as a spoiled prince that looked like Peppermint Patty could have been an interesting correlation as he grows up to be a warrior, but the movie just starts with him being Maximus 2.0. He even has a dead wife. \n\nThis made me wonder about other actors who tried to be action heroes and didn't cut it because they weren't convincing as macho meatheads. \n\nCan you think of other examples?",

        "selftext": "While at the Pasadena Playhouse, Holliman entered the Paramount lot by claiming he had an appointment with a studio barber. Eventually he became friendly with studio executives. Holliman first got a small bit part opposite Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in Scared Stiff (1953). Next he was cast as a marine in The Girls of Pleasure Island (1953), for which he needed a G.I. haircut. Finally he saw the barber and ended up with a haircut (and bangs) that changed his life.\n\nAfter he gained popularity in his image following a change in hairstyle, he then followed with three more films released in 1953.His many credits include: Broken Lance (1954), The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), The Big Combo (1955), I Died a Thousand Times (1955), Forbidden Planet (1956), Giant (1956), The Rainmaker (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Don't Go Near the Water (1957), Hot Spell (1958), The Trap (1959), Last Train from Gun Hill (1959), Visit to a Small Planet (1960), Armored Command (1961), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Anzio (1968), The Desperate Mission (1969), Smoke (1970), The Biscuit Eater (1972), The Solitary Man (1979), Sharky's Machine (1981) and Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge (1987).\n\nHolliman played a doomed helicopter crewman in the William Holden war drama The Bridges at Toko-Ri and a gangster's double-crossed thug in The Big Combo. He co-starred with Jack Palance in the crime drama I Died a Thousand Times (1955), a remake of High Sierra. He starred in The Rainmaker (1956), opposite Katharine Hepburn and Burt Lancaster, playing a rancher's timid son, who finally must defy his brother to gain self-respect, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture; he was cast in the role instead of Elvis Presley. His role in Rainmaker brought him such praise that columnist Louella Parsons cited him being \"as dedicated as though he were Marlon Brando and Anthony Perkins combined\".",

        "title": "La La Land's Ending: Intended Morals & The Journey to the Destination",
        "selftext": "Maybe my memory is hazy for not seeing the film for years, but I didn’t 100% like the ending.\n\nDon't get me wrong; it's NOT for the sole reason of Mia & Sebastian not staying together. I am not a hopeless romantic who thinks love overcomes all by any means. I do think it would have been less impactful of an ending (& less unique) if they stayed together.\n\nMy problem is HOW they got to the point where they didn't stay together.\n\nA common complaint I've seen about endings to anything in the last decade is \"It's not that it ended this way by default, it's how they got there.\" Many people who hated how Daenerys' character arc ended in Game of Thrones (no spoilers) would have been fine with it ending that way had there been more development. Instead it only came not just in the last season, but the last 2 episodes.\n\nIf Mia got her big break, Sebastian landed a gig on his own doing the music he wants - but their schedules get so hectic that they can’t see each other as much anymore despite their efforts & communications - then I wouldn’t have any issues (& the ending would have been less divisive).\n\nInstead (as far as I recall): it seems like they just had 1 fight, Sebastian says “you’re just an actress” & immediately regrets it, he misses her play because of a band photoshoot he somehow forgot about (which I guess they didn’t communicate about to make sure their schedules didn’t get messy), & she refuses to forgive him thus ending their relationship. It seems that one fight was enough to tank their relationship because Sebastian suddenly made a total dick move. Not communicating with her about their schedules, somehow not asking the band if anything was going on the same day as the play when they had a long time to prepare (photoshoots are planned 4-6 weeks in advance, I heard), etc. It seems like basic healthy communication skills that went out the window. & this all happened in a year!\n\nSo if the film’s point is “you have to make sacrifices to achieve your dreams, & that includes a person you love sometimes,” it falls flat if there wasn’t any in-character effort to keep the relationship afloat despite their schedules. If anything, I’d say the moral of the film seems to send is “find a partner who is compatible with your dreams & schedules & who will have a healthy communicative relationship with you.” Thus it's for THAT reason why Mia & Sebastian weren’t meant to stay together, thus Mia seems to find a much healthier relationship with David who did have a compatible schedule with her & put in effort to keep their relationship afloat.\n\nMaybe that was the message all along, but I got the impression it was more about “you have to give up love for your career” (even though she has a husband & a baby). Because in real life, you CAN have a career & a love life & family. You just have to find the right person to be compatible with in terms of careers & schedules + you both making effort to make time for each other & your family.  Sometimes that just doesn't happen no matter how much you love each other, but it's obviously not impossible since Mia has a family in the end & seems to have no issues\n\nTl;dr: I think the ending would have been more satisfying if they had Mia & Sebastian actively trying their best to stay together despite their growing success & failing, so they break up (if the point of the film was about love not always overcoming if you want to follow your dreams).\n\nThere is going to be a Broadway musical adaptation at some point, so I hope they do something like that.",

        "selftext": "After rewatching Monsters Inc, which is an amazing movie btw, something always confused me. So if you don't the main plot of the movie is that Monsters have a whole society the where everything electrical runs off of screams from kids. In Monsters Inc we see how it's the monsters job who are professional 'scarers' to use a weird magical door that does into the homes of children's closets so that they can scare them to get to scream. And we see that when they scream it fuels up a device called a scream tank, which allows it to be used as energy. We even at one point see a child screaming out in the open and it basically overpowers all the electrical appliances around her and short circuiting them.\n\nSo I'm wondering is it even possible in real life to use sound as an energy source? Or is this just something that exists in this weird world Monsters Inc?",

        "selftext": "I loved Mary Reilly and it wasn't the folly the critics kept announcing it to be. I loved the setting, the emphasis on the claustrophic nature of the house, the menacing sensuality of Hyde compared to the introverted Jekyl, played brilliantly by John Malkovich. There are scenes that literally shock you like when Hyde stomps a little girl to near death or every scene featuring Glenn Close as Mrs Faraday, in the scariest performance I've ever seen from her. Faraday made Alex from Fatal Attraction look harmless by comparison. \n\nThe brunt of the bad reviews was Julia Roberts and, to be honest, I didn't think she was that bad. On the contrary, I thought she gave a good performance as Mary Reilly. Was the accent bad? I don't know, but I did feel Roberts disappeared into this part, she made me believe she was a withdrawn and awkward maid with a dark past who becomes intrigued, fascinated and sexually attracted to Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. I can't help but believe Roberts was unjustly targeted because she was America's sweetheart playing such an against type of role.\n\nThe entire movie reminded me of \"The Company of Wolves\". At least, the direction. It had a bit of that eerie atmosphere with the fog and the cold brick houses. It made me think Stephen Frears could have done a Jack the Ripper movie. That would have been a riveting movie to watch.",

It does something nearly impossible in our sequel-glutted world: made me want further adventures.\n\n[Slashfilm] (https://www.slashfilm.com/1723102/disney-moana-2-review/) (7/10):\n\n>Fortunately, much like \"Frozen II,\" \"The Incredibles 2,\" and \"Toy Story 4,\" we may not have needed a sequel, but at least the one we got is enjoyable and manages to actually push the story forward.\n\n[Total Film] (https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/moana-2-review/) (3.5/5):\n\n>Moana remains as compelling a protagonist as ever in her much-anticipated sequel, whilst her reunion with Maui showcases the wonderful voice talents of Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. There’s plenty to admire in the animation and rich mythology of the tale, but it rehashes many of the themes and plot points of the original leading to a fun but less vital movie.\n\n[AV Club] (https://www.avclub.com/moana-2-review) (C+):\n\n>A ramshackle Franken-ship ... with more in common with straight-to-video sequels than the clever original.\n\n[Rolling Stone] (https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/moana-2-review-disney-1235175741/):\n\n>The overall sentiment seems to be something like Sequel 101: You loved the first movie, so here’s a second movie that’s a lot like the first movie. This is the good news if that’s what you’re after. If not, well: It’s one hour and 40 minutes.\n\n[BBC] (https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241126-moana-2-review) (3/5):\n\n>Despite all this Moana moaning, though, it's still a high-quality piece of work: a hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride that small children, especially, are bound to enjoy. The irony is that if it had been a television series, viewers might well have gushed about how spectacular it was. But as a film, Moana 2 wouldn't be near the top of any list of Disney's finest.\n\n[IGN] (https://www.ign.com/articles/moana-2-review-disney-dwayne-johnson-aulii-cravalho) (6/10):\n\n>While some of the elements still manage to get a laugh here, the world we were introduced to eight years ago doesn’t feel richer or more exciting.\n\n[Screen Rant] (https://screenrant.com/moana-2-movie-review/) (6/10): \n\n>The animation is still strong and the character beats are affecting, but the villain and his motivations stand in the film's way of true greatness.\n\n[The Wrap] (https://www.thewrap.com/moana-2-review-dwayne-johnson/):\n\n>There’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2, but the fact that it’s necessary to write 'there’s nothing particularly terrible about Moana 2' means something still went wrong.\n\n[The Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/26/moana-2-review-vacuum-packed-disney-ocean-adventure-that-will-leave-you-cold) (2/5):\n\n>It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency.\n\n[The Times] (https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/moana-2-review-disneys-soulless-sequel-is-a-flabby-rehash-fms8l067g) (2/5) :\n\n>The narrative stumbles forward in episodic fits and starts through self-contained story bites that have little impact on the wider, regrettably flabby, arc.\n\n**Synopsis**:\n>“Moana 2” reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.\n\n**Staring**:\n\n* Auli'i Cravalho as Moana\n* Dwayne Johnson as Maui\n* Alan Tudyk as Heihei\n* Temuera Morrison as Chief Tui\n* Nicole Scherzinger as Sina\n* Rose Matafeo as Loto\n* David Fane as Kele\n* Hualālai Chung as Moni\n* Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda as Simea\n* Awhimai Fraser as Matangi\n* Gerald Ramsey as Tautai Vasa\n\nDirected by: David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nWritten by: Jared Bush and Dana Ledoux Miller\n\nProduced by: Christina Chen and Yvett Merino\n\nEdited by: Jake Roberts\n\nMusic by: Mark Mancina (score and songs), Opetaia Foaʻi (score and songs), Abigail Barlow (songs), Emily Bear (songs)\n\nRunning time: 100 minutes",

Mulroney's acting and character are so bizarre its hard to not view this as a parody.\n\nSjp is clearly ACTING like she has pretty noticeable autism, and at times I thought everyone was aware of it - the dad being virtuous and trying to calm the tempers of his family because she has a disability... However that doesn't appear to be the case? And if it's not the case then why is sjp playing the role of an autist instead of a type a asshole? It's so damn weird. We build up all of her obsessiveness, ordly, random fact based trivia, inability to understand personal space, tone, etc.  this woman is supposed to be a well connected white collar worker..yet she has zero people skills, self awareness, social awareness, spatial awareness? It just screams autism and otherwise makes no sense.\n\nMulroney has no charisma with anyone...and his attempts to intimidate his family at times is so bizarre..like he's playing an action hero in a love drama? His character was so poorly written and executed with awful acting. We never once felt like he was trying to make the relationship work..he hung his GF out to dry at every opportunity.. \n\nI felt like this movie was leading up to the discovery of SJPs autism and them embracing her, similarly to how they've embraced all of the divergence to norms in their family. Their son is a deaf gay man who is in an interracial relationship..it felt like it was building up to acceptance.\n\nAnd then the brother..who immediately recognizes that the couple is not in love and starts making advances? To Mulroney immediately falling in love with his SJPs sister and her being immediately adored? \n\nAnd then we see a full frontal of Keaton's post op chest? The siblings swap partners and everyone is happily ever after? \n\nThere was more to unpack that I'm not doing a great job of unpacking.. but I was floored over how uncoordinated, poorly written, directed and acted this movie was \n\nThat said, it's fuckin hilarious for all those reasons.

I look forward to hearing your recommendations. I hope everyone is having a great day. Thank you in advance.",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nsince more than a month, I ask you for your favorite movie set in a given european country once a day and it seems like in this game, everyday, is a new day.\n\nLet's take a look at the day, where I asked you for your favorite movie set in Monaco, for example: The thread got 16 comments and the comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) included a suggestion for a movie that isn't really set in Monaco plot-wise for the larger part. Same with the runner-up. Because third place was shared by three films in terms of upvotes and downvotes, but they all meet the rules, I had to think again about how to proceed here. I have now decided to simply let chance decide in such a case (in this case: the Excel random number generator) and so ***La fille de Monaco*** (engl.: *The Girl from Monaco*), a 2008 comedy movie, has now won relatively unspectacularly.\n\nNow let's compare that with Netherland's tun yesterday: The thread got over 50 comments where 3 movie suggestions have reached the 30-point mark. And this time, the winner's plot is undoubtedly set in the Netherlands: We're talking about ***Zwartboek*** (engl.: *Black Book*) by Paul Verhoeven. This means that two films from the 2000s are about to land[ on our official letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) and it will be interesting to see whether this decade will actually end up dominating the list.\n\nAt first, today we are turning our attention to **North Macedonia**. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n>Day 33: Netherlands - Zwartboek (engl.: Black Book)\n\n>Day 32: Montenegro - Igla Ispod Praga (engl.: The Black Pin)\n\n>Day 31: Monaco - La fille de Monaco (engl.: The Girl from Monaco)\n\n>Day 30: Moldova - Carbon\n\n>Day 29: Malta - Luzzu\n\n>Day 28: Luxembourg - Läif a Séil (engl.: The Last Ashes)\n\n>Day 27: Lithuania -Vaikai iš Amerikos viešbučio (engl.: The Children from the Hotel America)\n\n>Day 26: Liechtenstein - Kinder der Berge\n\n>Day 25: Latvia - Kriminālās ekselences fonds (engl.: The Foundation of Criminal Excellence)\n\n>Day 24: Kosovo - Zgjoi (engl.: Hive)\n\n>Day 23: Italy - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (engl.: Cinema Paradiso)\n\n>Day 22: Ireland - The Wind That Shakes the Barley\n\n>Day 21: Iceland - Englar Alheimsins (engl.: Angels of the Universe)\n\n>Day 20: Hungary - Sátántangó\n\n>Day 19: Greece - Κυνόδοντας (engl.: Dogtooth)\n\n>Day 18: Germany - Das Leben der Anderen (engl.: The Lives of Others)\n\n>Day 17: Georgia - ცისფერი მთები ანუ დაუჯერებელი ამბავი (engl.: Blue Mountains)\n\n>Day 16: France - La Haine\n\n>Day 15: Finland - Mies vailla menneisyyttä (engl.: The Man Without a Past)\n\n>Day 14: Estonia - Vehkleja (engl.: The Fencer)\n\n>Day 13: Denmark - Jagten (engl.: The Hunt)\n\n>Day 12: Czechia - Spalovač mrtvol (engl.: The Cremator)\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.: Eastern Plays)\n\n>Day 8: Bosnia and Herzegovina - Ničija zemlja (engl.: No Man's Land)\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu (engl.: The Dream)\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.: The Color of Pomegranates)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

It's not bad, but I don't get its status. I've talked to people who thinks it's one of the best movies ever made, and it's many people's favourite Jim Carey movie. The premise is good but not ground breaking. I'm pretty sure it was done before on the twilight zone at least. I thought Ed Harris missed the mark in it, he just wasn't convincing. Some of the humour seemed forced, the wife doing ads etc.. and the catchphrase, like it's some great touchstone by the end of the movie. I feel like it was trying to be a deep movie but ended up being a mix of comedy and serious drama that just doesn't really work. Am I alone in this? I just think it's meh, not bad but not great.",

        "selftext": "When a movie gets a sequel, the studio wants audiences to know that it's a sequel to a popular film, so they'll make sure to include the title or part of the title of the original film and add something to it, like \"Title 2\", \"Title II\", \"Title Part 2\", \"Title: The Revenge\", \"Tit2e\", etc.\n\nThis can sometimes be weird when the title of the original film was very specific to the events of the original film but doesn't really apply to the plot or characters of later installments. For example, Friday the 13th made sense as a title because the events took place on a Friday the 13th. However, many of the sequels explicitly do not take place on a Friday the 13th, especially the third and fourth movies which take place in the days right after the 2nd movie. Another example is how the Karate Kid title made sense for the original and its sequels, but didn't really make sense for the Jackie Chan remake because it was about Kung-Fu and not Karate.\n\nSometimes the studios are aware of this and will just change the title of the franchise to something more recognizable. The first Indiana Jones movie was called \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", a title that wouldn't work for sequels because the Ark of the Covenant had been dealt with. As such, it was decided to just rename the franchise after the main character Indiana Jones, and the first movie retroactively became \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Same with First Blood retroactively becoming Rambo: First Blood once the franchise became Rambo.\n\nSo what other movie franchises have names that don't make sense in later installments, or had their names changed to something different from the title of the original installment?",

I love his hero changing from the start till the end.  \n\\- Nice battle scenes, blood and gore. Reminded me of those in Game of Thrones, maybe even better. Battle on frozen lake is my favourite. Taking moscow also.  \n\\- Nice atmosphere, costumes, sceneries.  \n\\- Ridley told that he didn't try to do documentary and mostly referenced Napoleon's letters. So it's a film about about a man, not a historical hero.\n\nAnd what I still didn't catch:  \n\\- Was It planned to include some black humour like sex scenes, shooting of the rebels and so on.\n\nP.S. I won't lie - I'm a great fan of Ridley Scott's movies. Mostly \"bad\" ones (like Counselor or Covenant) than highly acclaimed (like Gladiator 1 or Duelists).

For example, Chani’s love for Paul in *Dune: Part Two* strikes me as a more conditional kind of love.

The silence, the look in the characters’ eyes, the unbearable dread of what’s coming next… it’s all perfectly calculated to make us squirm. And it’s not just horror; films like *There Will Be Blood* or *Whiplash* use tension to stretch our nerves until they’re ready to snap. It’s like watching a slow-motion car crash, where you know something’s going to happen, but you can't tear your eyes away.\n\nWhy do we keep coming back for more?

        "title": "2023 Alternate Oscar Nominations: One Nom Per Movie",
        "selftext": "So I've made it no secret how much I loved 2023 but I also really did like the Oscar nominations this year. But it still saddens me how many great movies only got a single nom or went 0 for nominations.\n\nI already did an alternate Oscar noms a while back but I thought of different idea. I wanted to spread the love as much as possible and so came my biggest project to date: the 2023 Oscars with each movie only eligible for one nom. Even Best Picture nominees only get that Best Picture nom. I watched as many movies as I could to fill this list up which was a bit tiring but still rewarding with how many discoveries I made.\n\nTo give myself some ease, as a rule given how broad the field is, I did only look at the submissions for Best International Feature as to not find up having to go through dozens of other films (luckily this year's noms were all really good). I also did the same for documentaries and what were shortlisted entries but again, a lot of the shortlisted documentaries were all fantastic so no complaints there.\n\nI did also try to be as objective and fair. There are several movies I didn't care for or didn't like overall such as Maestro, Origin, and Showing Up but I could acknowledge one element that really did work that's at least worth recognizing. I didn't want this just to be a list of movies I personally loved ~~(that'll be a different list)~~\n\nAnd in terms of how I chose which movie went were, it was rather simple.\n\nThe Best Picture and Best Directing noms for instance would perhaps be the most well rounded in terms of derserving noms in acting, screenplay, directing, production, score, editing, etc. Poor Things just being relegated to acting would feel wrong given how much of that movie is impressive.\n\nIn terms of acting, it had to be for movies who rested on their central performance, even if the writing is thin or abstract thus why A Thousand and One, 20000 Species of Bees, The Iron Claw, Perfect Days, etc. got acting nominations. It's also why I actually moved Teachers' Lounge out of the Best Actress and into Best Screenplay, I just feel that movie is so sharply written, it would feel wrong to just give it an acting nomination. And speaking of screenplay, given how a ton more praise is given to its story, I graduated Godzilla Minus One from VFX to Adapted Screenplay (that and I actually watched Origin and seeing how badly written it was, had to replace it with something)\n\nSong and Score I judged how they fit well outside of the film and how much they would be enjoyed.\n\nProduction was straightforward but I did want to shout out Taste of Things because all of the food there was made onsite and that's part of the production and is a character of the film in and of itself.\n\nThe others are self-explanatory though I will say I went back and forth between movies in Make-Up and movies in costumes. Both had similar praise.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't add all graphics I made so here \n\n# BEST PICTURE\n\n**Anatomy of a Fall**\n\n**Barbie**\n\n**The Holdovers**\n\n**Killers of the Flower Moon**\n\n**May December**\n\n**Oppenheimer**\n\n**Past Lives**\n\n**Poor Things**\n\n**Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse**\n\n**The Zone of Interest**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dslamwxw663e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=20fbe2c7d6d02d9218e5bb19041e906692eae001\n\n# BEST DIRECTOR\n\n**Andrew Haigh** | All of Us Strangers\n\n**Hayao Miyazaki** | The Boy and the Heron\n\n**Victor Erice** | Close Your Eyes\n\n**Hirokazu Koreeda** | Monster\n\n**Andrew Shim** | Riceboy Sleeps  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1hdd9yw663e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=686cd6620966088914473f96c3abcfdc06c3a295\n\n# BEST ACTRESS IN A LEAD ROLE\n\n**Lola Campbell** | Scrapper\n\n**Mia Mckenna-Bruce** | How to Have Sex\n\n**Sofia Otero** | 20,000 Species of Bees\n\n**Teyana Taylor** | A Thousand and One\n\n**Tia Nomore** | Earth Mama\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u88fxvxw663e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d8752b4d8ab0eb6798acd0b3c46aa48ca79181a\n\n# BEST ACTOR IN A LEAD ROLE\n\n**Benoît Magimel** | Pacifiction\n\n**Christopher Abott** | Sanctuary\n\n**Franz Rogowski** | Passages\n\n**Kôji Yakusho** | Perfect Days\n\n**Zac Efron** | The Iron Claw\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aiy8kuxw663e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc64447d9e887a76f270a13206cd7c1454267b9\n\n# BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\n**Bottoms** | Written by Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott\n\n**Dream Scenario** | Written by Kristoffer Borgli\n\n**Rotting in the Sun** | Written by Sebastián Silva and Pedro Peirano\n\n**The Teachers' Lounge** | Written by Johannes Duncker and Ilker Çatak\n\n**Trenque Lauquen** | Written by Laura Citarella\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7wufxxw663e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=414453eb8b7fc042f6802ea7dc5f9e90d83820a9\n\n# BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\n**American Fiction** | Based on the novel *Erasure* by Percival Everett\n\nWritten for the screen by Cord Jefferson\n\n**Are You There God?

The movie I’m arguing for this year is The French Connection which is an essential part of my top 5 list which includes: Rocky, The Godfather, Lethal Weapon, and Die Hards 1 and 2. The French Connection takes place during the Christmas season. In one early scene Popeye Doyle goes undercover as a bell ringing Santa Clause and chases down the bad guy who’s on his naughty list. As he and his partner “Cloudy”follow “Frog One” through the cold wintery streets of Manhattan one can’t help but appreciate the one of a kind Christmas storefront decor for which New York is famous. It’s a “Single Guy Living in the City” type of Christmas movie, abundant in background Holiday scenery and never short of depressing 70s dystopian imagery. Without need for debate The French Connection is objectively a Christmas movie and a perfect “must see” for the entire family. ",

        "selftext": "I went into this only knowing the 3 actors listed on this poster and that the setting was coming out of the housing recession. \n\nThe story follows Dennis Nash, played by Andrew Garfield, a recently unemployed construction worker that gets evicted by Rick Carver, played by Michael Shannon, because his house that him, his mom Lynn, played by Laura Dern, and his son Connor, played by Noah Lomax, was foreclosed on and is owned by the bank and Rick Carver is the one in charge of the evictions issued by the bank. Dennis and his mom and son had to move into a motel, and they immediately find out that others who were evicted moved into the same motel complex. Dennis is taking inventory of his tools that are in his toolboxes and notices some are missing, and goes to Carver's business to accuse one of the guys who was taking Dennis' stuff out of his house after he was evicted. Carver comes out to inform the guys of another eviction he has to serve and is impressed by Dennis' gumption and offers him a job to work as a repairman on properties Carver gets evicted, and Dennis accepts. Over time, Dennis becomes Carver's assistant and starts carrying out evictions himself. It's revealed over halfway through the film that Carver and Dennis have similar backstories with their fathers having worked hard for nothing in return. Dennis is then issued to serve an eviction to Frank Greene, played by Tim Guinee, who is his son's best friend's dad but Greene fights the eviction and says the court will overturn it. Dennis asks Carver to take his checks as payments for his old house, and Carver tells him he will buy the house from the bank then Dennis will owe him what he pays for it, with the caveat that he can't move in for a few weeks but he can make repairs and repaint. Dennis surprised his mom and son with the house and they start working on getting the house repaired and repainted. There's then a big argument between Dennis and one of the homeowners Dennis had evicted, who moved into the same motel, all the while Dennis denies knowing him, because his mom and son don't know how he was able to get their house back. It eventually comes out that Dennis works for the man who evicted home, after Dennis presents his mom and son with a new house that he bought after selling their old house, his mom and son not wanting to live there and leaves Dennis to stay with Lynn's brother. Rick then gets his hands on a multimillion dollar deal, but it's in jeopardy when it comes to light that Frank Greene's fighting the eviction and the file is missing a crucial piece to solidify the eviction, which Mr. Freeman, played by Clancy Brown, and Carver draw up and have Dennis get to the court to get the eviction finalized. When Dennis shows up to evict Frank, and finds out he's armed, Dennis explains to Frank that he gave a forged document to the court to get Frank evicted, which causes Frank to surrender. The movie ends with Dennis sitting in a police cruiser while cops talk to Carver in the distance and one of Frank's children coming up to Dennis, who smiles then runs off.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed by this movie. It's a little under 2 hours long, and once Dennis and his family get evicted, the drama is pretty much nonstop. Michael Shannon is phenomenal as Rick Carver, you feel like he's up to no good instantly when you first get introduced to him. Andrew Garfield playing an unemployed single father, and Noah Lomax looking like he could be his son, were great castings. Laura Dern, as always, is great in this! I do love the backstories on both Dennis and Carver, even if we don't get Carver's backstory until the last 30 minutes or so. It's one I'm gonna have to watch again to see things I missed. \n\nMy rating: 4.5/5\n\nDo I recommend? Yes.\n\nBest performance: Michael Shannon\n",

        "selftext": "Okay so it's been awhile since I read about this, I might be getting some details wrong. \n\n  \nIn the early 20th Century, Berlin and Venice were the only big international film festivals in Europe. France was jealous and wanted to get in on it. Mussolini and Hitler were in power, and when a French film lost the grand prize at Venice Intl Film Festival 1938 to an Italian film that was endorsed by Mussolini, they said that's it, and the French government created an international film festival as an official act. They decided on Cannes because it was a seaside, picturesque area and thought the end of the summer would be a perfect time of the year for it, so they decided on August 31st.\n\n  \nThe first night, a Friday, only had one film screening, and Cannes had paid a ton of Hollywood film stars to come on an MGM yacht and shmooze, so they were drinking and hanging out and gossiping, with the understanding that the next day would be the real start of the festival, with multiple movies playing and discussions and all that. However, Germany invaded Poland on that day, September 1st, 1939, and the Cannes Film Festival was delayed, then 10 days later, France declared war on Germany and officially canceled the festival, sending all the American celebrities home, and the first real Cannes Film Festival was in 1946, after the end of WW2. \n\n\n\nI think it's such a crazy, bonkers idea that people would eat up, World War 2, based on a true story, Hollywood, celebrities, all in the same movie, I am absolutely shocked that nobody has made a movie about it, it seems like a perfect idea.

I love my friend and respect his opinion. But I’ve noticed a lot of people around me focus more on the actors than the actual content of the film.\n\nSo, I’m curious: What makes a good film for you?

Sometimes, it turns out, that one or another of the suggested movies wasn't really set in the given country. That seems to be the case with *To Catch a Thief*, the \"winner\" of the Monaco round, which unfortunately shows no sign of actually being set in Monaco to any great extent. The runner-up in the voting - *Grand Prix* \\- unfortunately doesn't fit the criteria here either. As all the other films have the same number of upvotes (minus downvotes), I'll have to think again about how to proceed. However, yesterday's result is somewhat more rewarding: ***Igla Ispod Praga*** (engl.: *The Black Pin*) wins for Montenegro. \n\nHonestly, I really thought, that *Casino Royale* would win, when we come to Montenegro, but at this point, it seems as people have learned from what I call \"the Belgium accident\", where a not-so-belgian movie made the cut. As always, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens today, when we move on one letter in alphabetical order to N for **Netherlands**. As always, there are only two rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: As the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix has not yet been announced, I will refrain from attaching an updated list of the films here and instead want to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) . make sure to give it a like!",

        "selftext": "I recently saw two Christmas movies in which there appear to be unintentional camera moves. I alway figure that everything in a film is intentional but these are a bit disorienting so I’m not sure. \n\nThe first was in “Elf” when James Caan tells Buddy to get out of his life in the conference room, slams his fist on the table, and the camera moves. \n\nThe second was in “Home Alone” when Kevin is jumping yelling “I’m living alone” and the camera shakes. \n\nAnyone have an explanation for these? Examples of others?",

Was Jimmy actually gonna kill Karen in that scene? It obviously seemed like it but I couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be ambiguous. \n\n4. Was Paulie also gonna whack Henry regardless?\n\n5. When Tommy says “come on bring the coffee to go” and then says “I’m joking what’s the matter with you” (paraphrasing) is that a joke on how he’s always saying it’s hard to tell if people are joking or not and they need to word things differently? \n",

Are we clinging so tightly to the past that we’ve stifled the creativity needed to move forward?

At this point we know that the movie is in the real world. I have no doubt that Cobb starts assembling the team in the real world.\n\nBut here is where I believe the movie takes a turn. The scene in Mombasa, where they are meeting with the chemist, they show the basement where people come to dream and explain that this becomes their reality. Cobb wants them to show him how the sedative works. After this scene, Cobb fails to spin his totem and for the rest of the movie we never see him use his totem.\n\nI believe Cobb is still in the dream world in Mombasa.\n\nOne issue that I see with this theory however, is that Cobb is seen entering the dream state prior to the Mombasa scene. I'd explain this away that it was only 1 level with no sedative, but may require more discussion.\n\nI'd love having more discussion surrounding this.",

While pretty much everyone is an arse but the main protagonist points it out and is quite likeable. In most John Hughes films the \"bad\" guys would be the ones calling out the \"good\" guys. \n\nTake The Breakfast Club, one of the events portrayed as \"good\" is when they take Ally Sheedy's character and change her from what she is into a clone of Molly Ringwald's character rather than saying, \"this person is different but that's OK.\" \n\nI could go on, i've seen a few John Hughes films over the years and each one is generally dreadful. If he had written It's A Wonderful Life the banker would be the one the viewer would be expected to root for. \n\nAnyway fuck John Hughes in general but I can't deny that with Home Alone something went right.

What a world! Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness?*\n\nIt’s not bad acting, but it’s so hammy that it’s funny. \n\nSince Hollywood and the standard of movie goes has changed a lot over the years…\n\nWould her performance have as much high praise if she was cast now? \n\nI get the feeling today it wouldn’t have as much praise. I don’t believe she would be blasted and blacklisted from film though. \n\nI think it would be looked at as more goofy than scary. \n\nAgain no hate all to Margret.

Since I awakened my taste for romantic movies last year, I have pretty much watched all of the classics and some more, and it's a similar genre to horror in that it's harder and harder to be surprised by plot or execution. But you know, this one hits just right.\n\nImagine you're stranded on a spaceship for the rest of your life with one person of the opposite sex. You're both good-looking, smart, love what you do and have a lot in common. You are probably going to spend the rest of your lives up there, so... it's only natural that some sensations come to arise. Won't say anything more, but it has nothing to do with that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence movie.\n\nAnd that creates such an interesting moral dilemma that is actually quite simple in theory but turns around the very conception of \"love ethic\" for me. I won't go into details as I got into it by just reading a two-line synopsis, but I would like to highlight the acting which is a very important factor for this movie to work.\n\nI didn't know Zoë Chao, never seen her acting but hey, she is very good here. I'm hoping to see her more, I don't know her range, but she nailed it here and it was no easy task to go on par with Anthony Mackie, the real surprise. In my opinion, he has always been one of those actors that I see something in him, but he doesn't get the best roles for him for that something to shine. Well I think he shines here finally. Very charming, both of them, and they're given a good script that works and has a great pace to it.\n\nAnyway, if you're in a soft mood for a feelgood movie, this will be perfect.",

But the threat of the entity was barely present, it felt like a cringe comedy with occasional gore shots mixed in. \n\nMy main dissapointment was the main character, Skye. Really interesting perspective with the mc being a celebrity and my god, did Naomi Scott tried her best. But there's only so much you can do with half of your dialogue is the word \"fuck\". I have no issues with her being flawed, and i suppose i'd be swearing like a sailor if i was in her position but it's just not entertaining to hear the swear words over and over. \n\nAlthough there were some positives i suppose. The car scene was the highlight and Naomi simply nailed it with her desperate screaming, some of the songs sounded like a legit pop stuff you can hear on the radio, Naomi Scott is hot (sorry but yeah i said it).\n\nBut i guess there's just no potential for a franchise or a sequel.

        "selftext": "Hi! Do any of you have any good recommendations for sites that host a plethora of different lists, where one is able to check off movies? There is this great site called [250films.net](http://250films.net), which I've been using myself for years. Problem is, the site is seldom updated and it is full of bugs. For example, it hasn't been possible to load lists with over 500 entries for quite some time now. I have no idea who runs the site and I've tried e-mailing the webmaster on several occasions throughout the years, but have never gotten a reply. Kind of enigmatic! I'm guessing the site is run by someone who has it as a project among several others, and just updates it when there's time. The site is intermittently down as well. It has a Facebook page which I don't think have been updated since 2018.\n\nProblem is, there are no other sites with an equal amount of relevant lists AND a design that doesn't do your head in. I have glanced at the site called \"icheckmovies dot something\" several times and have even created an account, starting to check off lists, but... I just can't with the way it looks, and I don't appreciate the \"create your own list-community aspect\" of it either.\n\nI've tried googling for something akin to [250films.net](http://250films.net) for ages, but can't find anything. Do any of you guys have any tips? Would be much appreciated! I don't want to give up on 250films dot net, but as the years go along, it gets wonkier to use :-(\n\n(I use Letterboxd a lot by the way, but don't like their system for lists - it's not the same thing as you have to add movies that count towards your total of watched films, to check off their lists.)\n\nBonus nostalgia: do any of you remember the old top250 dot org for the IMDb Top 250? It was this extremely basic site with a beige background, and when you clicked one of the titles (\\*just\\* the title, followed by the release year) it got crossed out. Loved that! It was probably the first of its kind that I used.\n\n(This text was originally posted in r/TrueFilm 24/11 (2024) but erased after 2 hours, possibly because it didn't fit the criteria of \"in-depth film discussion\".

        "title": "In considering criticism and negative regard for the first two Fantastic Beasts films, I feel they’re being treated unfairly…",
        "selftext": "In viewing the critiques, I can’t help but feel like a lot of individuals who could care less about Harry Potter as a story rooted in literature are shaping the narrative around why the films, more specifically their stories, are good or bad, and that is a bit frustrating to me. This is different from how the Star Wars prequels or The Hobbit were treated - with those, you at least felt the people criticizing and insulting them were truly knowledgeable about the stories and worlds they were talking about. Here, that’s less the case. It doesn’t seem to me that a wide segment of the GA hated the films casually, but that there is a concerted attempt from sociopolitical activists and “fandom campists” online to tear them down. \n\nI am particularly struck by the desire to bowdlerize the Potter series, in a weirdly malicious way. This treatment seems to underpin a lot of the nonsensical criticism the Fantastic Beasts films get (and the original Harry Potter films got, to a degree). These critiques are often oriented around deliberate misunderstandings of basic plot, tonal preference, or infantilized, pre-determined expectations and a refusal to take the story seriously from the get-go: \n\n1. Skewed Expectations for Critique\n\nWhen audiences insist on framing a franchise as childish or simplistic, critics may feel pressured to engage with it on those terms, even if it was never intended to be consumed that way. This can lead to shallow critiques that fail to address the franchise’s actual thematic or artistic ambitions.\n\n2. Overshadowing the Franchise’s Original Goals\n\nA desire to reduce a franchise to a childish or nostalgic framework can overshadow its creators’ intent. When this oversimplified perspective dominates, critiques may focus on how “fun” or “whimsical” the franchise is, rather than acknowledging its deeper narratives or cultural significance.\n\n3. Nostalgia as Infantilization\n\nNostalgia can play a significant role in framing a franchise as simplistic. Audiences who experienced a franchise in their youth may cling to a sentimental view of it, resisting any attempt by newer installments to grow or evolve. Critics responding to this infantilized view might either cater to it or dismiss it, but either way, it distorts the discourse around the franchise’s actual merits.\n\n4. Infantilization as Cultural Critique\n\nWhen a segment of the audience infantilizes a franchise, it can reflect broader cultural tendencies to avoid grappling with complexity or to view certain genres (like fantasy, animation, or superhero films) as inherently juvenile. This creates a dismissive atmosphere that can stymie meaningful critique by associating entire genres or franchises with immaturity.\n\n5. Resistance to Growth or Change\n\nAudience-driven infantilization can lead to hostility toward creative risks or narrative complexity. If fans expect a franchise to remain static and “simple,” any deviation—whether in tone, storytelling, or thematic depth—may be rejected outright. This resistance can influence critiques, as critics may feel pressured to side with or against the infantilized expectations.\n\n6. Infantilization and Gatekeeping\n\nViewing a franchise as inherently childish can also gatekeep who “should” engage with it. This can discourage serious critique by framing the work as unworthy of intellectual or artistic analysis. Critics may shy away from deep evaluation if the audience insists the franchise “isn’t that serious.”\n\nI’m still stuck on that perspective of thinking Fantastic Beasts ran into trouble because of people on both sides of the critical spectrum liking or disliking Harry Potter (and by extension  “the Wizarding World”) for what it was not, rather than for what it actually was. I hesitate to make that point because I guess it becomes kind of “gatekeep-y”, but I do think huge parts of the GA have a bowdlerized and completely stunted, false idea of what Harry Potter, the WW and Rowling’s writing, is all about (they would, of course, never read the books, and this infantilization tactic likely was a chief excuse as to why they wouldn’t and will not). And so you get this horseshoe coalition of “I love Harry Potter because of chocolate frogs and Quidditch” and “I hate Harry Potter because it’s kiddie doodoo crap” both promoting a warped picture of what the story is or should be, hating Fantastic Beasts because it didn’t conform to their most bowdlerized, infantilized expectations (hunting beasts, everything taken literally, lots of humor, action, and “Harry Potter” tropes, one simple storyline, with no hard-to-follow subplots or narrative complexity, etc). \n\nIt makes sense precisely because of what critics singled out for praise (anything cute and cheaply funny), and what they claimed was “getting in the way” [sic] (basically everything else, anything that brought gravitas, etc). It’s no surprise that the only thing Reddit seems to consistently say about the Franchise is “it should’ve been magical Indiana Jones”. Whenever they talk about the first film, they deliberately miss massive chunks of plot, or characterize it in a way that is completely inaccurate to the story and its tone. Fantastic Beasts 2 was going up against this, and it already had a mountain of weirdly extreme hatred and dismissal aimed at it prior to its release.",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nfollowing [the idea of another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fpkzac/favorite_movie_by_state_fin/), I ask you for your most favorite movie set in a given european country once a day since more than a month so far. Yesterday, it was Monaco's turn and I had a hunch that it would be difficult to find a movie that was really set (almost) entirely in that country. When it comes to movies where the plot takes place in more than one country, I really like [the formulation of my predecessor, who once wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1e1yi2e/movies_by_state_hawaii/):\n\n>If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.\n\nFor example, this would rule out *Grand Prix* in case of Monaco. But now my question is whether this should also disqualify the actual winner of the voting: Unfortunately, I've never seen ***To Catch a Thief***, but I thought that most of it was set in France. Even the (rough, I don't want to spoil myself completely) synopses I've read don't indicate that the movie would be largely set in Monaco. So once again I need your help here: Would you say, that the movie is really \"rooted\" in Monaco plot-wise? Thanks in advance - and [here is the link for the discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monaco/comments/1gyr6pc/favorite_movie_by_european_country_monaco_which/).\n\nAs long as the discussion is still ongoing, we will continue in alphabetical order to the next country with an M: **Montenegro**. And these are the rules:\n\n* It's about where the movie is set plot-wise and not about where the movie was filmed. In case of historical movies, it's important that the bigger part of the movie takes place in a geogprahical territory, that is part of the given country today. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country - but it has to be a large part.\n* Winner movie is the movie with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes) after 24 hours. Therefore, it's important that you only mention one movie per comment and that you check up if you're movie was mentioned in an earlier comment before you suggest it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\nP.S.: As the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix has not yet been announced, I will refrain from attaching an updated list of the films here and instead want to draw your attention to [our official Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) . make sure to give it a like!",

        "selftext": "Ok, I'll be honest, I didn't like this film at all. I know most people liked it and I was looking forward to it too but this one didn't work for me.\n\nPart of that might be my miscalibrated expectations. I thought since it was called Day One it might be about people figuring out the rules — you have to be silent, natural repeating sounds can be a cover etc. But that wasn't the case. After the initial attack it cuts to everyone being quiet.\n\nBut if that was all I would've been only mildly disappointed and then adjusted to what the movie was actually trying to do but it's not really doing anything different or better than the other two films. It's just a regular monster movie with two characters running and hiding from monsters. And I know that's sort of what the first film is doing but that film did a lot with its visual language in building tension around silence and the possibility of sudden sound. That's what made these monsters feel unique. \n\nThis film completely eschews that in favor of generic running and hiding sequences. There's always a convenient rain, thunde or fire to allow characters to talk. Sometimes they talk even without any cover. A huge crowd of people can walk without attracting the monsters (until it somehow does) but at other times the film wants us to believe that a small sound will attract the monsters.\n\nThe human story isn't much better. The performances are great but they don't really have much to do and their arcs go about the way you'd expect.\n\nUltimately it's the lack of tension (that permeates the other films) that bothered me. The one good scene that reminded me of what I like about this franchise was the scene where Djimon Honsou has to keep a guy quiet but ends up slowly killing him while his son watches. \n\nAnd yes you can do different things with a franchise but the monsters in this franchise are unique for one reason and if you don't take advantage of that in your storytelling then they kinda become generic monsters. If that's the approach you want to take, fine, but then the human story has to make up for it.\n\nThis one was a letdown.",

The “silencio” performance scene stands out to me. The emotions in this movie, the dream like states, the conspiratorial scenes; it all comes together in such a cohesive way. I’m reminded of when they intro Betty, and she’s overacting positivity to the degree of a 1940s American film, almost certainly deliberately. And then the cut to her grandparents smiling maniacally as they take a cab. David Lynch is almost like the Ween of movies, his films capture all genres. Like in Mulholland Drive, there’s horror, drama, comedy, romance, suspense, mystery, and more. This film is an insane achievement for David Lynch in my opinion. ",

        "title": "Mash Ville: A Helter Skelter Korean Neo Western",
        "selftext": "Mash Ville is a little difficult to untangle. It takes place in a rural Korean town which has been nearly cleared out by a pair of gun toting cultists. Their mission: collect 12 bodies, each with a birthday corresponding to a different month. The film's ensemble cast stumbles into this strange ritual and must fight, avoid, or otherwise outwit each other to survive. Among these characters are dimwitted moonshiners trying to collect a poison brew before it kills anyone, an alcholic movie propmaster, and a psychotically laughing police officer.\n\nI tend to be skeptical of movies that go out of their way to be quirky. Despite the eclectic synopsis, the movie's jokes rarely feel forced. It's a bonkers black comedy that manages to pull out a few suprising twists from it's interconnected stories. It does drag a little bit in the middle, but it's an unpredictable little movie with an interesting vibe. It apparently made a splash at Fatnasia Fest this year. With it's unique take on so many genres it's easy to see why.\n\nAs a fan of westerns I found the perspective interesting. I recently finished \"Late Westerns: The Persistence of a Genre\" by Lee Clark Mitchell. Mitchell argued the biggest commonality between modern westerns is a Bewildered Protagonist: that modern cowboys are frequently overwelemed, confused, or outmatched by a world that they can't understand, much less change. That fits this movie to a T.\n\nThe small town is a strange rural pocket. You're reminded that the rest of Korea isn't exactly far away. The cultists make a kind of artifical ghost town through their actions. They say that their ritual will bring about a new world, but given their actions, as well as traditional korean garb, it feels as though the frontier is attempting to claw itself back – a reset button at the end of a gun. The psychotically laughing sheriff is also facinating. Over the decades the wild west hero has been pushed from upright, to jaded, to morally dubious, to now outright deranged; as if he was put through the cloning machine from Multiplicity.\n\nI wrote more about the movie, but I figured I'd ask you guys if you got the chance to see it and what you thought.",

He knew that the Feds already had eyes on their operation, and as good as the GOON crew were at their part they weren't exactly playing their role with enough caution that Jimmy found viable. He's a professional. Remember the diner scene where Jimmy chooses the seat that can scope out whos coming and going? Very paranoid/cautious man. Jimmy = a cold blooded killer but has a code of conduct to a degree. IMO he mostly wanted to cover tracks by erasing the trail that can be led to him and his main fellas. **Johnny Roastbeef**, the GOONfella that bought a pink Cadillac Eldorado and his wife a white mink fur coat was a HUGE deal to Jimmy.\n\nJimmy knew that even though his crew were good at executing a heist, they were too much a liability that couldn't be trusted/ignored. For crazy paranoid men like Jimmy all it took was one bad domino. From a business stand point, to Jimmy it was best to get rid of them before they \"fold under pressure.\" And remember he learned the art of paranoia from Paulie. Tommy was a huge unhinged liability but Jimmy and Tommy were like brothers, and when Tommy got wacked it was one of the few, if only, times Jimmy cried in his life over a man. Tommy was one of Jimmys few weaknesses and if Jimmy didn't consider Tommy actual family he would have dug another hole in the desert.\n\nI personally think the most brutal scene of Goodfellas was the opening scene. Tommy stabbing Billy Beaten Bats in the trunk the way he did, and hearing the sound of his mothers kitchen knife enter and exit, with Billy making those agonal noises to me was pretty realistic and brutally raw/macabre for a movie. Or should I say CINEMA? Jimmy knowing that the human body can survive many stab wounds deciding to finish Bats off with a .38 snub nose revolver. The dead silent ominous night with that red glow from the tail lights..\n\nRight off the BAT I feel it set the mood for what kind of film it would be going forward.\n\nI am curious to see your thoughts on the matter. :D",

So to see that the guys in question chose that particular group of women, it’s….unlikely. \n\nI do wonder though if it was supposed to actually oddly enough make it MORE believable of a situation though because it was unlikely they would seriously be missed? If there is one thing we learn in the 24 hour news cycles, it’s the only missing women that make waves are generally blonde(mostly) and pretty. Otherwise, the countless other women that do go missing constantly are largely ignored. \n\nAll that being said, it just didn’t let me really get into the movie for some reason and I’m guessing I’m not the only one, hence it not being “successful”.

        "selftext": "This post will contain any spoilers about the whole movie franchise from the 90s to early 2000s. This does not includes the recents ones because those suck (in my opinion).\n\n\nSidney Prescott literally outvictims any other main characters that survives in horror movies. Like literally. Imagine that life was going so well, then BOOM. Your mom dies. You’re slowly healing from that pain, then BOOM. Random students begin to die at your school. Sounding like the typical Halloween movie you see on tv. Then your closest friend dies and you’re scared for life. You’re scared to trust anyone when your boyfriend is the leading suspect for murder. Then come to find out, your boyfriend and his best friend did commit murder for “no reason”. \n\nBoyfriend dies and the friend goes  to jail (don’t quote me in that, I don’t really remember).\n\nLife moves on, and then Sidney goes to college with people now taunting her with her past. The bodies began to show up again where she goes to school. Coincidence? It’s a horror movie that basically follows the basic horror rules. It leaves Sidney’s insecurities to resurface. \nShe loses more friends and ANOTHER boyfriend is lost. Comes to find out, it was a classmate and your first boyfriend’s mom. She decides to kill Sidney because  Sidney’s mom was the reason why Stu’s parents divorced. Other guy? I think he enjoys the killing.\n\nThird movie, Sidney goes into hiding to try to avoid more killing of good friends. The movie starts with another victim of the first movie. He recently has a part in the new movie based on her life. He ends up dead by the new killer. The new killer finds her and taunts her, saying this was gonna be the last ‘movie’. Keep in mind, all the movies lead to this. The classic movie rules are strict. Who else knew how to directs a movie other than a director? Obviously the director. Who then turns out to be your half brother.\n\nWhy? Why did he ruin your life?\n\nAll because your mother abandoned him and started her life over. She acted like he wasn’t her son when they met.\n\nSidney basically got her whole life upside down….for something her mom did.\n\nMoral of the story: Don’t have an affair. Other wise your child is gonna get all her friends murders.",

It was previously released on DVD and blu ray but they are both long out of print and have never been given another release, it's not even available for streaming.\n\nSome people believe it may have something to do with music clearance rights with the soundtrack but there is no definite answer as to why Disney and 20th Century Fox haven't given this gem a new release.

        "selftext": "Basically, movie stars have peaks and valleys in their career, so \"comeback\" roles are inevitable. What are your favorite ones?\n\n1.) Natalie Wood in [\"Splendor in the Grass.](https://youtu.be/s-CKnxqdRZg?si=5rWIpyz-9rZ16zKC)\" She'd made some crummy movies after being lauded for her breakout role in \"Rebel Without A Cause\" (and would again after this), but she really did hit it out of the ballpark with her role as Deanie Loomis, the fragile teenaged girl who is driven mad by her first love.\n\n2.) Saoirse Ronan in [\"Brooklyn.\"](https://youtu.be/15syDwC000k?si=EGYWBqfzVOgsIWAn) A lovely, beautiful story that had Saoirse Ronan fully complete that transition from the child actor that wowed in \"Atonement\" to a bonafide leading lady. Things had been kind rocky for her especially after \"The Host\", but \"Brooklyn\" definitely put her back on the radar as a talented actress.\n\n3.) Hailee Steinfield in \"[Edge of 17](https://youtu.be/NTMziMm7G2I?si=ftz7p0r0ByAUVzN8).\" A coming of age story that had Hailee Steinfield complete the transition from child star to bonafide leading lady. She came right out of the gate with an Oscar nomination for \"True Grit\" but kind of seemed to struggle to find another good role, which often happens a lot during that child actor/adult actor transition.\n\n4.) Ke Huy Quan i[n \"Everything Everywhere All At Once](https://youtu.be/Do-CfOPfkUs?si=3HAy0BkCT45gqwwg).\" Former child actor of the 80's (best known for the Goonies and Indiana Jones) who transitioned into other aspects of the industry. I really loved his performance (as well as everyone else's) and it was really cool to watch him come back and get an Oscar for his efforts.\n\n5.) Reese Witherspoon in[ \"Wild](https://youtu.be/tn2-GSqPyl0?si=2v9za3goUYhHr74N).\" She was similar to Natalie Wood in that she made a bunch of lousy movies that paid well but damaged her credibility as an actress, but she did a great job in Wild.",

I thought he was great in The Imitation Game and received a well deserved  Academy award nomination for that. Most of his roles are in movies that are just not the type movies I like. It’s hard to judge a performance under the circumstances. What do you think? Is he one of this generation’s great actors?",

The month isn’t up yet, but I've had such a good time with so many of these, I wanted to share now in case anyone was looking for random watch recommendations over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nFYI, I try to lean into my subjective experience in my scores, and there is a lot of room for me between liking a movie and being blown away by a masterpiece. I also often like or dislike something without strong emotional feelings. This means a lot of people might rate things further towards love and hate, while I rate a lot towards the middle. It doesn't mean I'm not having a good time!\n\nMy rankings don't always line up with my scores. I don't know why--it just happens that way sometimes. Here's about what each score means to me:\n\n5.0 - Rare masterpiece  \n4.5 - Fantastic, top-shelf, personal favorite  \n4.0 - Loved it  \n3.5 - Really liked It  \n3.0 - Liked It  \n2.5 - Okay / meh  \n2.0 - Didn't really like it  \n1.5 - Really didn't like it  \n1.0 - Actively disliked/annoyed by it  \n0.5 - Angry at it\n\nFinally, because sometimes it helps to know someone's pov, I’m a middle-aged white dude.\n\nWithout further ado, here’s the list:\n\n**1 - Challengers (2024) - 4.5/5**\n\nChallengers is electric and kinetic and ridiculous and thumping and smashing and mean and confident. Are we still talking about tennis?\n\nThere are moments it almost starts taking itself too seriously, then some clever camera work or the fantastic Reznor/Ross score or an absurd amount of trash blowing around in a storm releases the dramatic tension enough for the pulsating style and sensuality to remain the driving heartbeat of the film.\n\n**2 - Perfect Blue (1997) - 4.5/5**\n\nAs well written and tightly constructed as any psychological thriller ever has been. There are hard-to-watch, leering scenes of brutality. There is also contemplation on what it is to produce and consume such things. And also what it means to judge such things. Sometimes these all come twisted up together. The layers in the text and subtext will reward multiple viewings. It deserves to be well-known and recognized for its brilliance.\n\n \n\n**3 - His Three Daughters (2023) - 4.5/5**\n\nAn intimate portrait of family as we wish it to be: difficult but unbreakable. The performances are simply fantastic. The transcendent, optimistic ending spares the audience of truer difficulties and family drama. It’s better for it.\n\n \n\n**4 - Chime (2024) - 4.5/5**\n\nA worthy spiritual successor to Kurosawa's Cure, Chime is an unnerving short film with unexplained acts of casual violence and a slipping grasp of what it means to be a human in the modern world. The alienation of characters from their work, their passions, and those around them, along with the rising sense that not everything we see is what we think, gives the film a feeling of an off-kilter piece of cursed media.\n\nKurosawa is excellent behind the camera, and is matched by the wonderful cinematography and sound design.\n\n \n\n**5 - The Apprentice (2024) - 4.5/5**\n\nIt takes its time, but once this movie reveals itself, it's absolutely captivating. Full of terrific, evolving performances. Looks right and sounds right. At the heart of the film is a terrifying idea: maybe these dark sociopaths know what America really is, and the rest of us are just deluded idealists.\n\n \n\n**6 - In Bruges (2008) - 4/5**\n\nA special movie that is funnier, sadder, and sweeter than it even tries to be. The central relationship here makes you want to spent time with these characters, even if it’s In Bruges.\n\n \n\n**7 - Road to Perdition (2002) - 4/5**\n\nA beautifully made killer-with-a-heart-of-gold revenge movie. Predictable and at times overwrought, it's endearingly earnest in its self serious gangster drama. Mendes has a firm grasp on what he wants from scene to scene, and ends up delivering a very good film with a number of great performances.\n\n \n\n**8 - My Old Ass (2024) - 4/5**\n\nMy Old Ass is a charming coming-of-age romance fantasy that suffers a little from its unrelenting sweetness and an over-the-top, idealized portrait of a privileged care-free youth that will feel unrelatable to most viewers, including this one. But it's also more than that, and although its big reveal isn't all that surprising, and its central lesson is not unique, the way it unfolds will hit some viewers like a much-needed ton of bricks. Including this one.\n\n \n\n**9 - Fallen Angels (1995) - 4/5**\n\nKar-Wai Wong does his own thing as a filmmaker, and the effect is mesmerizing. The camera, and therefore the viewer, end up right at home amongst this group of after-dark Hong Kong weirdos, basking in the surreal vibrant false colors of the night.\n\n \n\n**10 - Quiz Show (1994) - 4/5**\n\nExcellent period drama exploring the relationship between media, government, money, and truth. The themes are as relevant as ever, but it's not exactly reassuring.\n\nThe pacing is deliberate and patient, but ends up covering a lot of territory in surprisingly efficient construction. The performances, direction, sets, and camerawork combine to balance the larger-than-life nature of the institutions in focus with a grounded view of the characters (It's worth noting that, with one exception, the drama is seen as conflict between white male elites. Everyone else is downstream collateral.)\n\n \n\n**11 - The Fall Guy (2024) - 4/5**\n\nAn excellent action comedy full of ridiculous set pieces one after another. Gosling has mastered the comedic lovable idiot. Could have benefited with a more aggressive cut. Satirizes it’s own lampshading without dipping into too-cool self mockery.\n\n \n\n**12 - Hit Man (2023) - 4/5**\n\nThe bog-standard presentation of this film is like the Honda Civic that obscures the identity of something more exceptional inside. Powell is a joy to watch as he cycles through personas, and his character's evolution through the story hits the mark.\n\n \n\n**13 - Emily the Criminal (2022) - 3.5/5**\n\nAn unconventional anti-hero story that seeks to subvert its conventional aesthetic. Has a lot on its mind and isn't particularly subtle. A little too melodramatic at times.\n\n \n\n**14 - The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022) - 3.5/5**\n\nLovable film that knows how goofy and self-indulgent it is, wearing it on its sleeve with both charming self-awareness and earnest glee, thankfully avoiding the familiar cynical winking resorted to in too many films. In this the movie echoes Cage himself, and is all the better for it.\n\n \n\n**15 - LaRoy, Texas (2023) - 3.5/5**\n\nTerrific dark comedy with heavy Coen brothers influences. Full of inept characters crisscrossing in their attempts to dig themselves into or out of a hole. Steve Zahn steals every scene he's in.\n\n \n\n**16 - Thelma (2024) - 3.5/5**\n\nThelma has a lot of fun with its form and formula. Full of clever and sweet comedy that produce genuine laughs, but even more full of love for the brilliance of what it is to be human: silly, resilient, needy, young, old, determined, and ultimately destined to diminish and die.\n\n \n\n**17 - Miller's Crossing (1990) - 3.5/5**\n\nWitty and tough, with crackling dialog, stand-offs, and old-school shootouts. The perspective follows the protagonist, Tom, as he ping-pongs his way around rival gangsters, bookies, and a love triangle, scraping by on thin margins, playing life on hard mode, cool and disaffected throughout.\n\nIt's his disaffected nature which threatens the film the most, but the Coens are at their best with tight-spiraling stories, and although there might not be much sympathy for who lives and dies, there's enough plotting and progress to keep up the interest in seeing what happens next.\n\n \n\n**18 - Saturday Night (2024) - 3.5/5**\n\nUses the familiar faces and iconic images as ingredients in a pressure cooker of a film that leans into its dramatized nature, filling its runtime with funny little slices of moments that feel true and authentic to the legends as we remember them. It's well done, but the trade off is there are moments one wishes they could get off the ride and wallow in the nostalgia.\n\n \n\n**19 - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) - 3.5/5**\n\nBoth an LA-based crime thriller and a ironic RDJ quip-fest that wants to make fun of its flaws before you do. It's constant lampshading can feel a little cheap and unneeded when there are real moments of comedy on hand. Val Kilmer's cool performance owns the film.\n\n \n\n**20 - Woman of the Hour (2023) - 3/5**\n\nKendrick shows a lot of talent behind the camera, putting together beautiful images and lingering shots that let the characters dwell in the tension on screen. Unfortunately the construction and writing produces a safe and sanitized version of a story that should be far more unsettling.\n\n \n\n**21 - Weird: The Al Yankovic Story (2022) - 3/5**\n\nSeems obvious that Weird: The Al Yankovic Story would have to be a parody of musical biopics. Not always great, but always weird, and playful enough that even when the story loses momentum, it's still a lot of fun for those who grew up listening to Weird Al.\n\n \n\n**22 - Lisa Frankenstein (2024) - 3/5**\n\nAdorable goth teen fantasy romcom with fun music, fashion, and dismemberment. It plays it quirky, cute, and safe, and endears for not trying to be something it's not.\n\n \n\n**23 - Speak No Evil (2024) - 3/5**\n\nThe film is good, and I would have likely rated it higher if I hadn't seen the original released just two years ago. It starts off just as that one did before eventually diverging and providing a new alternate ending (that manages a clever nod back at the first). James McAvoy and Aisling Franciosi are captivating and freaky.\n\n \n\n**24 - Look Into My Eyes (2024) - 3.5/5**\n\nBeautifully shot and edited, Look Into My Eyes is a documentary film that certainly isn't going to persuade anyone to change their minds about the veracity of psychic channeling. Which is fine, because it's not trying to. Instead it sees its subjects with a warm, sympathetic, nonjudgmental lens and asks viewers to see them not so much as authentic psychics as authentic humans.\n\n \n\n**25 - Lowlifes (2024) - 3/5**\n\nDark comedy that delivers a few pleasant surprises. The satire doesn't always work and there's not much in the way of suspense, but the short run time keeps things moving along nicely.\n\n \n\n**26 - Emilia Pérez (2024) - 2.5/5**\n\nThere is a lot to admire, but the film wobbles and waffles on what it’s really about until it ends up reducing itself into something shallow.\n\n \n\n**27 - Snack Shack (2024) - 2.5/5**\n\nThis movie almost works because of the chemistry and energy of the three central actors, despite the grating nature of much of their dialog. In the end it’s too long, has too many contrived dramatic moments, and fails to evoke nostalgia either for any certain time or age.\n\n \n\n**28 - Brothers (2024) - 2.5/5**\n\nA bad movie in which good actors can't find their characters but still somehow manage to keep things just watchable enough to get the audience through it.\n\n \n\n**29 - Wolfs (2024) - 2/5**\n\nThere might be a movie somewhere in this Clooney and Pitt bromance, but one would need a high tolerance for their flirty banter to bother sifting it out.\n\n \n\n**30 - Salem's Lot (2024) - 2/5**\n\nThe things the film does well are completely overshadowed by clunky writing, acting, and editing.\n\n ",

I was screening it for a movie night and the reaction they had towards the movie was that the middle portion with Stan and Mary taking drugs was quite unnecessary. However, I do not think the movie would be a classic without it.\n\nIt is my first time watching the film. I believe I need to watch it again to gain the nuances. The 2nd act of the movie was distinctly more surreal compared to the first and last act. The sudden cuts between Joel grappling with his loss of memories and how Patrick was manipulating Clementine to Mary and Stan having a merry time were an artistic choice and to a non-cinephile, it really removes the tension from those scenes, which is a fair criticism.\n\nI don’t really know what to feel about this? I believe that the subtext was that it made the situation that Joel was in even more absurd. While he is grappling with his own “mortality”, the workers are nonchalant and take this whole process with a seemingly disregarding manner. The idea of this company was not even willing to give the patient the respect they deserve shows a sort of callousness the company has.",

        "selftext": "I am not buff, so maybe the assumptions I make in this post are false. But something I've noticed for years is how characters who are muscular in action films tend to grunt a lot or say \"OOF!\" or similar involuntary hings in action scenes. I know this is such a trivial detail, but I find this an odd choice. For example, in scenes wnere the protagonist is of normal build and is being chased by a buff antagonist or grunt, or is fighting one, the buff opponent will do a lot more grunting than the hero. But I'd assume this is not realistic, because physical efforts should be easy for large muscled people?\n\nI first noticed this in the kids movie Spiderwick, when the buff ogre is making all sorts of grunts climbing the house to chase our kid protagonist and the kid is climbing with ease. Here is the scene, two minutes long: [https://youtu.be/1xI\\_CHaHWmw?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/1xI_CHaHWmw?feature=shared)\n\nBut then I noticed the same thing happening again and again in adult action films, whether serious or comedy.\n\nIt's not a bid deal. It's just a weird choice directors seem to be making that most people probably don't care about or notice.",

Also, including or at least mentioning the CWD (chronic wasting disease, which often affects deer and basically turns them into zombies) seems like a no brainer for a flick like this, though it's most likely... well, not even gonna be mentioned.

It centers around a housewife in the superficial, chemical world of the late 1980s in California. Some may find this movie boring or slow, but I loved it. Julianne Moore’s character gets increasingly sicker and the viewer is left wondering if her ailments are psychosomatic or environmental. Maybe the truth lies somewhere in between. The film captures that synthetic feel of the 1980s And is barely saturated in color. Moore seems to be lacking in her own agency in her life. She’s childlike and we get very sparse dialogue from her. This character has deep psychological problems and the viewer is left wondering if she will ever find a place internally and externally that’s secure and safe.",

For example the doctor hugely meeting was halfway through the movie instead of at the start and was related to the Medi talker which I didn't like this. Also, the dad took over the mom's role as of being the supportive one in the mom was just mostly gone. Mrs V also didn't teach Melody a thing Mrs V did not teach Melody how to roll over Mrs veedon upgrade her talking board Mrs V didn't help her program the Medi talker or anything Miss V does in the book. I don't know if anybody else has read this book but I have read this book so many times I can't even count anymore and the movie was so incredibly not up to the book standards that I just don't think it should have even been made.",

The last spot is very much up for debate in my opinion though. Personally, I think the following films could have a legitimate case:\n\n- Thelma & Louise\n- Black Hawk Down\n- American Gangster\n- The Martian\n\nI would go with The Martian as I’m a huge Matt Damon fan and find the story to be super charming. American Gangster would be a close second for me cause Denzel’s performance in it is incredible (as always). Curious though what others think. Would love to hear some opinions. ",

        "selftext": "\nSome characters and series are so iconic that it’s nearly impossible to imagine anyone else stepping into the role. Think Indiana Jones, Jack Sparrow, or John Wick. Recasting them often risks losing the very essence that made them beloved in the first place. Instead of taking that gamble, what if we embraced animation?\n\nAnimation opens up limitless storytelling possibilities without tampering with the charm and legacy of these characters. It allows creators to dive deeper into their worlds, explore untold stories, and experiment with bold new ideas—all while maintaining the spirit fans fell in love with.\n\nWould you prefer an animated expansion of these worlds over live-action recasting or remakes? What other iconic characters or series could benefit from this approach? Let’s discuss!",

I just finished watching gladiator 2 and wondered how these director are making movies at this age. The instant thing that came to my mind was that The Assistant Directors does the MAJORITY of work and these people just do guidance . I was wondering how much exact work these directors are doing on set ? What is the actual process here. Is it somekinda \"ghost directors\" kinda situation. People who have worked with these directors please tell us in detail. Thanks.",
