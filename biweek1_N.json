I received a free month as it was back then without having to submit any payment information. At the end of that first free month, I went on a one-week vacation in Barcelona. During this vacation, I received a notification from Netflix that my complimentary month was ending so I had to add my payment details to continue my membership, which I did. At that time, I the Standard Plan cost the same in Spain as in Romania. I used my PayPal account to pay for the membership, by the way, so I didn't notice anything weird about it.\n\nFast forward six years, and today I got an email from Netflix telling me that they're increasing the price to 13.99 euros. As I don't usually pay much attention to my automatic subscriptions (I know, my bad!) the price sounded pretty high so I went to the Netflix Romania website where to my surprise, the Standard plan cost only 9.99 euros. So I was like, WTF!? Taking a look at my payment history I see that at least for the last few years, I've been paying 12.99 euros for the Standard Plan. While talking to support, they asked me if I live in Spain because all along I've been paying the cost for the Spanish Standard Plan. I told the support, that I live in Romania and haven't visited Spain since 2018. Of course, they told me there was nothing they couldn't do about it and that I should cancel my current plan and restart it again after it expires to switch to the Romanian price.\n\nOf course, I am partially to blame for this situation, but since Netflix can easily find multiple people abusing a single account, can't they figure out you have lived for the past 6 years in a country and paid the membership for another country? At least a notification or something, FFS.\n\nSo yeah, I'm canceling and never getting back! \"Thanks\", Netflix",

It started out with her relationship with JJ before getting into details about Bobby (I think they might have used an alternative name to Bobby?). It didn't include any interviews with her family, and was just her telling story. It also didn't include an interview with Bobby and wife, or any photos of actual Bobby. It did include details about the intimacy they had over phone, and I think they showed a photo of her cousin and also sound clips she had from \"Bobby\". I'm banging my head against a wall trying to find out what the hell it was I watched but all I'm getting is Sweet Bobby.

        "selftext": "The diplomat season 1 was one of my favourites netflix shows in a long time. The writing was sharp, nuance and interesting. Kate and Hal have the fish out of the water situation that sometimes is ridiculous, but grounded with discussion about foreign policy and politics.\n\nI was so excited for second season to the point that I rewatched the first season last week. And it still hold up to what I remember. The was a nice blend between homeland and the west wing. Tension and idealism. The writing was so masterfully crafted that I replayed some of the dialogs.\n\nI'm very surprise and somewhat disappointed about season 2. There are still glimpses of the good show from season 1 of course but going through it feel like a slog, compared to season 1 where I felt like I couldn't get enough. \n\nFrom storypoint perspective, it moves very slowly and unclear where things are going, except for a few notable scenes such as the church and hosptial discussion scene. Kate and Eidra convo is always a stand out from season 1 but it feels like that overdo it just because it worked well last season. \n\nKate as a character feels stuck. At least a few months have passed in the show and she still doesn't remember her staff names and only talkes to a few people again and again. For someone who supposedly a very successful diplomat in a wat zone, she sure has the biggest chip and her shoulder and cant even do well with managing her office and staff. Sure she doesn't like the photoshoot and wearing fancy dresses but grow up. That's the job, she cant just treat her staff badly because of her stress.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a criticism on Kerry Russel who have been brilliant and I've admired from The Americans time.\n\nStuart is just insufferable here. I don't need to explain. He used to be so cool last season.\n\nThe Denisson and Kate relationship are just ridiculous now. It was a little bit eye brow raising last season on how much the supposedly party olanning only role for American ambassador has so much push over a British foreign minister. This season is just absurb. He comes to her any time she calls and he just told her the supposed Throwbridge push just as an aside, even though it's huge to tell the US that the UK is going to replace their own PM. \n\nTo be fair I'm only at episode 3 and the only reason I hang on is I know Allison Janney is coming soon. But it's already have the show and we barely have anything happening.\n\nI wonder why the writing took such a nosedive. It's not just about the plot, but the dialogs between characters are so awkward and unnatural. I wonder if it's because of the writers strike that happened and of it affects across the industry. Thinking about House of the Dragon who also had a similar writing nose dive in the second season after an acclaimed first.\n\nHanging on to this and hope the next few episodes would change my mind.

It was about **3 kids** who worked together as a secret team. They had a lair and everything, **(2 guys, 1 girl,)** with an advanced sci-fi esque car, *I do not recall it talking* but it had different abilities and forms depending on the monster of the week. The main setting was their own school, a cliche middle school setting.\n\nThese monsters of the week were animated in a children's crayon art style. They would scribble and move like a kindergartners drawing. *I do not remember if they were drawings that came to life, or if this was just the show's art style.* There would be a scene every episode where they would get stumped by the monster, return to their lair and think of a new plan. The lair was either a cave or one of the characters basements.\n\nI have looked for this show everywhere, I have asked around this Subreddit & the Discord at least once since 2021. I would love to know if this show is genuinely lost or if anyone truly knows what it is. Please, help me find this Netflix show.\"",

The whole point is to watch them when I am not connected to WiFi without using my data. Literally the day before I watched my downloads without issue. I deleted all downloads and downloaded them again, tried different shows, no fix. Maybe I need to reinstall the app?\n\nObviously I could switch my settings from „WiFi only“ to something else, but wouldn’t that mean that I will end up using my data after all? I really don’t wanna test it tho… \n\nI kinda confused and wonder if other people also have that problem… thanks for your help!",

The real question here is did the scammers manage to get hold of my payment date as well as my email address or is this just the fluke of the century?  And, if they did get hold of the payment date, surely the only place they could have obtained this information from is the Netflix system itself.

I’ve grown to like the actor that plays Zuko more but the rest of them aren’t anything like how they are in animations. Their character and personality is but they’re not slim and fit and borderline attractive like they’re shown in the original series (I know it’s weird to say that about a cartoon but wtv) I’m not fat shaming but Azula, Mai and Ty Lee are just chubby lookin kids when they should be slim and look older.

Black sails - not as well known but it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and it’s one of the only shows I’ve been able to watch all the way through again. \n3. The boys - not quite on the level of these others in terms of plot and overall quality but extremely entertaining and a 10/10 performance from Anthony Starr.\n4. Peaky blinders - yes another basic one, but this show has honestly become underrated. It gets too much hate for being “too popular” that people have forgotten how good it actually is!\n5. Vikings - would be higher but the death of Ragnar made me lost interest.\n6. Invincible - only animated series on this list, once again probably not on the same level as these other shows but in terms of personal enjoyment it’s one of my favourites.\n7. Sopranos - I’m gonna say something crazy but I think this show is slightly overrated, the acting is great and it’s entertaining but has a lot of empty episodes that I found myself having to force myself to sit though. That being said it’s still all time and I appreciate that subjectively it’s one of the best of all time.\n8. Barry - the first season is some of the best TV I’ve ever watched and the first half of the last season aswell, it’s a fun watch with some great performances.\n9. Family guy - very different from the others but I’ve watched the whole thing a few times so it has to be here\n10. Ozark - the first and second season are unbelievably good, it sort of drops off from there in my opinion. Still great though. \n\nHonourable mentions - modern family, suits, the Simpson (early episodes), the walking dead (earlier seasons), game of thrones (I only had the chance to watch the first season before it was removed from the streaming service I was using, but will revisit later and revise) and prison break.\n\n\nAlso before you come at me, I haven’t watched shows like breaking bad, snowfall, the wire and etc so will update when i get to it.",

He was gonna rat them out to the landlord cause their place got messed up?  Huh?  And he was gonna start taking care of her mom to what?  Get her more hooked to drugs?

I also have my own Google TV that I use on the go and it still works outside of the house.\n\n  \nDoes this happen to my father because he is away from the household for too long? Like after a certain amount of time of not being under our wifi does his phone automatically get removed as a device and he has to come back? I'm not 100% sure how this works or how to mange what devices can be authorized or not. \n\n  \nAlso he believes it's because the email address of the Netflix account is not the same as the email address on his iPhone apple account. I don't think this is correct and it has nothing to do with the password sharing thing Netflix is cracking down on but I figured I would say this. I just need someone else to confirm this is not how this works and it is not the cause of him not being to use Netflix on his phone outside the house.",

        "selftext": "I just finished The Frog, and it seems like some people had my reaction where the beginning started off pretty intriguing, but it kind of fell apart and just became increasingly ridiculous for me. I felt like I was setup for this complex and philosophical show, but it ended up feeling like a generic thriller with a very basic Good People vs Bad People morality, with no real character depth. I liked the stylistic choices, including the nonlinear and intentionally confusing editing, but it just felt they were trying to dress up a very generic thriller that didn't really dive into its initial potential.\n\nFor me, at least, what I was anticipating to happen I would have found more interesting. I thought both stories were happening at the same time, and that there was going to be a different reveal - the main antagonist was murdering victims, but then passed the bodies over to her accomplice, the serial killer who gets arrested in the motel. No one suspects the antagonist because the serial killer takes the blame for her kills.\n\nI thought that over time, the two main characters (hotel owner and vacation rental owner) would discover this connection, and start to work together to build the evidence against the antagonist by finding subtle clues she leaves behind during her stays. She stays this initimidating looming presence, instead of the ridiculous character she ends up being, while they try to find ways to trick her into leaving more evidence.\n\nThen, over time, they discover this bigger connection of how she and multiple people are working with her to dispose of her bodies for her. She uses multiple people that go to different hotels that get increasingly difficult to track down.\n\nOverall, I just felt like the show was at its best when it was a slow burn, full of tension, and feel like it could have really capitalized on that. The acting and cinematography were really strong and could have been even stronger with different writing, IMO.\n\nCurious what other people think about the unrealized potential in the show?",

Obviously Gacy wasn't any rocket scientist too because he wasn't Jack the Ripper who the cops couldn't catch.\n\nOn a different note, John Gacy arguably was both a victim and a villain. His dad used to whack him when he misbehaved and his mum who would catch him stealing her underwear would force him to wear her clothing outside in order that his peers could poke fun at him. This is probably what caused his psychosis besides drugs.",

Today I wanted to add an extra member to my account and I quickly skimmed through all the next steps without realizing I had to choose the $7.99 option instead of the $5.99 (canadian). I went to account settings and no option, called Netflix and they said only option was to cancel and re-add. Fine\n\nI cancelled and re-added. Just to find out you cannot add your 2nd extra member until the billing cycle ends because Netflix only allows to send 2 invitations per billing cycle so me canceling to re-add the same user counts as two.

How can some women be so gullible/oblivious that they keep on claiming to be in a relationship with someone they have never met? Why does it take them so long to realise that it’s all a scam?\nAnd on top of it they say that “catfishing”should be illegal and victim shouldn’t be shamed. Like seriously?! How about first behaving like a 35 year old smart and mature woman?\nMaybe I’m being too harsh but I really don’t understand how these women (or men) think.\n\nPS: I am saying women because most of the series that covers such topics have women as their victims. I am not trying to label any gender here. ",

But for a series with multiple seasons, is there someway on Netflix to tell what year each season was released? For example on HBO Max, each season lists the year it was released so you wouldn't have to google it. \n\n*edit* \nI know you can google it. I was wondering if I was missing something on Netflix that told you that information already.",

But they don’t act like they’re married. It’s more like she was someone with a crush on him that wasn’t returned. \n\nAre the grandparents really dead? At the very end the aunt asks where they are and then the movie ends, as if they’ve been dead all along. But then the scene with the grandfather in the hospital would make no sense. But then at the end all the credits are part of the hotel, and there is something with each of the grandparents pictures. But none of the credits are translated so can’t tell if it’s just some random credits or was like a tribute to the grandparents or something confirming that they were dead. \n\nWere the two geckos supposed to mean anything? Through most of the movie I thought they were his dead parents, then at the end, if the grandparents are dead I thought maybe they’re actually them instead.

I think its been at least 6 months since I tried to watch in a browser.  It was certainly before I installed Sequoia.  Everything is working fine on my streaming devices.  My OS is up to date. Chrome and Safari are the latest. I made sure there were no extensions running in the browser.  I cleared cache, cookies, etc and even rebooted.  Nada.  It does the same thing- plays for a split second when I click the play button and stops.  I can advance the position using the progress slider and the image changes, but it stops playing. I checked the javascript console for any errors and I see nothing there.  The network panel shows that all the netflix pages loaded properly.\n\nI'm not sure what else to check.  Next stop will be Netflix support tomorrow, but I'm not chatting with them at 3AM.  I've already tried everything in their support documentation.\n\nHas anyone experienced this problem recently?  I'm wondering if I have some kind of accessibility option enabled on my system that is detected and aborts playing.  As far as I know there is no dedicated Netflix app for Mac and while the M1 can run ipad/iphone apps as well, the Netflix iOS app is not marked as compatible and cannot be downloaded on the Mac.\n\nUPDATE: The problem appears related to the use of Bose QC Ultra bluetooth earbuds.  Playback worked this morning without them paired, so I tried with them and got the same result as last night.  It pauses immediately after the play button is clicked.",

The shots of New York City are so gorgeous too! I wish they focused on the properties and city more.

They also had a teenage sister that they were raising together. They were involved in some kind of mob/mafia business which is also why or how their brother died.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

When I first watched it after being recommended by a movie channel on instagram, I thought it would be a typical terrorism based film with lots of killing and moments of sympathy. However, after watching it for the first time, I was completely flabbergasted. \n\nThe unraveling of Nawal's story, her incredible resilience, and the gut-punch of a final revelation made it one of the most gripping and intense cinematic experiences I've had in a long time. What really stuck with me was the way Denis Villeneuve captured the intersection of personal tragedy and broader historical conflict, making it feel both intimate and epic at the same time.\n\nIt's not an easy watch, but Incendies is one of those films that stays with you long after the credits roll, forcing you to reflect on the complexities of human nature and the devastating consequences of hatred.\n\nSome other movies that surprised me includes, Children of Men(2006), The Hateful Eight(2015), Tumbbad(2018), The Village(2004).\n\nShare your experiences.",

Turns out he was born in 1925. So he was 8 when na*is came into power, 14 when the war started and 20 when it ended. In 1943 he enlisted with the Luftwaffe to become a fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was deployed. \n\nAfter the war he continued his flight training with the British and was one of the first German pilots to be granted a license by the allied forces. He was also a member of the SPD, which is the social democratic party in Germany. \n\nI'm not saying it's impossible for him to having held auch views at the time, but he was an influenced young man at best. And he wouldn't have gotten training by the British if he was really deep into the politics of the third reich. \n\nIt's just a small thing and I get that they wanted to get the story across that Lou Perlman would have sold his soul to the devil if the money was right. But it comes across as \"Oh my Gosh! He made business with Germans in the 80s and 90s! They must have all been na*is!\", which is rather annoying for us Germans.

I'm not victim blaming, but it almost always takes two to tango.\n\nWhatever it is, that first-ex in the Ben Foster episode was just a dumb POS.

There's just a lot about the movie that missed the mark for me. \n\nAnd it starts with Netflix themselves spoiling the climax of the movie by making it the TRAILER. Which left me with the impression that it was the beginning of the movie which completely derailed my expectations and threw me off when it turned out to be more of a subtle pressure cooker/slow burner. \n\nAlso the premise of the movie is misleading. Its advertised to be the story about Cheryl Bradshaws close call encounter with Rodney Alcala. But this doesn't even really occur pretty much til Act 3 over an hour into the movie. \n\nIn fact. Cheryl almost feels like a side character in a movie about Alcala. Which would be fine it's just not the movie they marketed. Sadly this was just a case of expectations vs reality. And the reality is I don't feel it lived up to my expectations ",

We're not constantly changing but we'll keep a service for 6-9 months and then close it and go for something else, mostly to get fresh content.\n\nFor whatever reason, we've not had Netflix, specifically, for about 4-5 years.  Back then, I recall that Netflix was the king of having the content we wanted and probably for the first 2-3 years after we dropped it, if I ever googled something I wanted to watch and which streaming service it was on, 90% of the time it was Netflix.\n\nWell now we have it and my wife and I like to rewatch a lot of the classic kids films rom our childhood with our children.  The thing is... there's nothing!  I've even used some of the common category codes, most of which are suggested in articles from over a year ago and I never find anything.  In fact, the only truly 80s/90s kid film I van find is The Little Rascals (which we actually watched with our kids earlier this year.)\n\nI know there are some things (we watch The Karate Kid last week) but literally, I've searched for 30-40 classics and they aren't in the catalog.

        "selftext": "This is to help explain something that not everyone seems to grasp about the newest plan Netflix has rolled out across so many regions. If you're on ad based netflix you no longer have access to the entire catalog, that's made very clear by the 'all but a few shows and movies' in the comparison between the plans on Netflix webpage. This is because the ones they can't show you are licensed to not be played on anything with ads, including Netflix exclusives because of the other license holders. You can also only use it on certain devices, certain brands and ages of smart TV aren't compatible with the DRM they use, meaning you have to either replace the screen or get an external box. You're unable to cast with that plan as well, meaning everything you want to watch has to be streamed from the device you're watching it on.   \n  \nIf you want to have the same experience as you had before the ad based plan existed you must go to ad free, which is around double what you were paying for the most basic ad free version. There's also features that aren't available on the standard plan but they're stuff like fancier audio codecs, and how many screens you can watch on/devices you can download to. Otherwise they're nearly identical. But again if you want the same thing as your single screen SD netflix plan you must go to the cheapest ad free plan, end of story. There is no other way to receive the same experience. So either shut off netflix and move on, or upgrade.",

The new plan they automatically switched me to is cheaper (6.99), but with ads, and the ability to stream on 2 devices simultaneously. I was planning to see how irritating the ads are for me and my husband. It streams fine on a really old phone I use for bedtime watching. Decided to watch something with hubs on Samsung Smart TV,  and it won't play. It says the TV does not support the ads. And I should upgrade to the next plan.This seems like a total racket to me. Is it? Is there a work around? We planned to upgrade after baseball season is over, but now I'm pissed, and don't want to. ",

        "selftext": "On 10/5 I logged into my netflix and noted that an additional profile had been added - the profile had the name \"Osa\" and had watched several movies & shows. This profile was NOT added by myself or anyone in my household.\n\nI navigated to the Account page in Netflix > Devices > Manage Access and Devices & could see that someone was watching on an iphone. I 'signed out' of all devices and also hit the 'Sign out of all Devices' button at the bottom. I also changed my password hoping that these measures would remove this person from the account.\n\nLater that same day, I logged back in and another new profile was added - this time with the name \"Hey\" so I knew whoever had hacked my account had managed to stay logged in or had been able to figure out my new password. I again 'Signed out of all Devices'. At this time I also changed my email password in case that was being hacked as well.\n\nThen on 10/10 I logged in and see a newly added profile with the name \"Usher\". At this time I again 'signed out of all devices'. I also requested to completely cancel and DELETE my netflix account. Since my auto-pay had just gone through, the account would not be deleted until the end of the pay cycle (in November). I put PIN restrictions on profiles and reached out to netflix support. Netflix support went through a few things with me and convinced me not to DELETE/Cancel my account as they confirmed adding PINs and signing out devices should block someone from getting back in.\n\nToday I tried logging in and my password was not working. I was able to request a code be sent to my email and am able to log on via that code. When I get in, I see another profile again with the name \"Hello\" - i can see they changed their gamer tag on netflix to \"heynotcoolman\" - they also added a custom PIN so that I could not get in or delete their profile. And they had changed my password.\n\nI went into my email and searched netflix - I could see emails over the last couple of days stating that I had changed my password (this was not me, this was the hacker - in order to change this they would have had to know the password I had changed it to on 10/5). I also saw an email about the PIN they added - the email indicated that at that time the profile's name was \"Sorry idk who's netflix this is but it put me here\" - so they are continuing to communicate with me weirdly as they keep hacking my account. I also saw that they added an \"extra member\" to my account which would change my monthly fee from $15.49/month to $23.48/month starting in November.\n\nI know that I need to delete this account as somehow this person keeps getting in. I am hoping someone may have a guess as to how they are doing this? I am concerned about what else they may have access to. I do not believe they have access to my Gmail account as my Gmail uses 2-factor authentication and I didn't receive any notice of someone trying to log in before or after I changed my password on 10/5.\n\nCould someone be doing this through my wifi? Do I have malware? What should I do? And why does it seem to only be my netflix and why are they seemingly taunting me? Seems like this has happened to other people!",

Many beloved series had slow starts, struggled with ratings, or took time to find their audience—meaning they probably wouldn’t have lasted more than a season under Netflix's modern approach.\n\nHere are some examples of shows that might have been canceled before they could become the cultural staples we know and love:\n\n1. **Breaking Bad (2008-2013)** *Breaking Bad* is now considered one of the greatest TV shows of all time, but its first season didn't attract huge audiences. If Netflix had been in charge, it could have been axed early, before it had a chance to grow into the massive hit it became.\n2. **The Office (US, 2005-2013)** The first season of *The Office* was met with lukewarm reception and modest ratings. The humor didn’t click with everyone initially, and Netflix might have pulled the plug after just a few episodes. Thankfully, NBC stuck with it, allowing the show to develop its unique voice and fanbase.\n3. **Parks and Recreation (2009-2015)** *Parks and Rec* had a rough start and didn’t hit its stride until later seasons. Under Netflix's current rules, it likely would have been canceled before we ever got to see the brilliance of characters like Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope fully developed.\n4. **Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)** Despite its passionate cult following, *Buffy* was never a ratings juggernaut, especially in its first season. A modern Netflix approach might have dismissed it as too niche or quirky, missing out on the massive cultural impact it eventually had.\n5. **Twin Peaks (1990-1991)** *Twin Peaks* was groundbreaking but far from mainstream, with its surreal style and odd pacing. It developed a fiercely loyal fanbase but also confused many viewers. Under Netflix's data-driven model, it’s hard to imagine the show surviving past its experimental first season.\n6. **Arrested Development (2003-2006)** Although beloved by critics, *Arrested Development* struggled with viewership during its original run. Netflix eventually revived it years later, but if Netflix had been in charge of the show back in 2003, it likely would have been canceled before the Bluth family could become a cult favorite.\n7. **Star Trek: The Original Series (1966-1969)** Star Trek wasn’t an instant hit, and ratings were mediocre during its original run. It was only after years of reruns and fan conventions that it gained legendary status. In a Netflix world, it might have never made it to season two, let alone the iconic franchise it became.\n8. **Firefly (2002)** Even though *Firefly* was canceled after just one season by Fox, its dedicated fanbase kept it alive through DVD sales and conventions. Today, it’s a cult classic. Netflix’s strict cancellation policy could have doomed it to obscurity even faster, leaving fans without hope of ever seeing its potential fulfilled.\n\nThe common thread here is that all these shows needed time to build a fanbase, hone their tone, or just find the right audience. In today’s fast-paced streaming world, where shows are expected to hit big numbers immediately, these gems might not have had the chance to grow into the classics they are now.\n\nWhat do you think? Which other iconic shows would have been canceled in a Netflix-style world?",

Literally no excuse in 2024. And jt’s such a shame as Jill Halfpenny and Claire Goose’s acting are fantastic.\n\nBut it’s as if a 15 year old Film GCSE student wrote a script for a homework assignment. With the basic formula of a psychological thriller- doing so to demonstrate their understating of the common genre. And they got a C+ for it, because it hasn’t been fleshed out enough. And then somebody turned it into an actual TV show, without editing the script at all from the students submission.\n\nThat’s what it’s giving.\n\nWhen the husband was being “interrogated” by the police- which felt more like a therapy session, I had second hand embarrassment for the casts who clearly just need a pay-check. \n\nOr how the daughter is so easily brainwashed that she starts acting like zombie to the point that the series almost changes into a horror/ zombie genre in front of my eyes. \n\nAlso you can’t “kidnap” a 15 year old, and that girl was big enough to move out anyway. And the way it takes the wife FOREVER to notice there is something up with the lodger despite all the obvious signs.\n\nAnd the school bullies, who are not intimidating in the slightest. And then they got “scared off” by the lodger- but it’s such a low effort script they couldn’t be bothered to show us what that threat was. We just have to assume she went ghetto on them, as it’s filmed from a distance, from the daughter’s point of view.\n\nI could go on and on. The plumber’s wife. The strange career the husband is trying to peruse where he is asking for loans rather than investments which would be more credible. The necklace. The safe. It’s every bad move trope and cliche.\n\nAnyway if anybody is still reading this thanks for getting this far!",

Knowing that it’s a domestic violence case, and that the victim is terrified of the perpetrator, you don’t have the compassion on you to escort her and make sure she’s safe??? I’m truly truly sickened and disgusted. I’m so upset Ben foster died, he should have had a chance to rot in prison.

Him hiding his face crying while they beat Marlon to death, then showing him panicking, then he’s crying to the gay detective saying “you have no idea what it’s like to have to hide a part of yourself” as if there’s some parallel between being a pedophile and being gay that they secretly relate on. Not to mention his reformed ex at Lux who’s no longer a sex trafficker but has sex trafficking (and murder) going on under his roof, so he gives the tape out like a hero and then runs off into hiding to escape responsibility. They make the client list seem like closeted gays who were found out, not pedophiles, like we’re supposed to forget that client list was going to get access to 9 year old Edgar soon if Raya got him.

        "title": "*spoilers* What did you like or dislike about the \"Starting 5\" series on NBA basketball players?",
        "selftext": "What did you like or dislike about the series?  \n  \nI've read some online reviews they felt this series was too 'manicured' or 'fake' to showcase a more clean cut image for the NBA's more famous players. People also said they found it 'boring' because the players didn't show as much personality. All fair points. \n\nAs a big basketball and NBA fan, here are my comments after watching the series:   \n  \nI personally quite liked the show although the personalities are not as colourful: This is when I compare to say athletes they followed on other Netflix sports series like \"Quarterback\" or \" Receiver\"  (both about American football athletes) and even \"Sprint\" (about world class sprinters) but I quite liked how we got to see the more 'human' side of the NBA players.    \n  \nI liked they focus a lot on the family of the athletes: It's not to say after watching this that LeBron James, Jimmy Butler, Domantas Sabonis or Jayson Tatum are suddenly winning fathers of the year but I do feel that their loving interaction with their kids felt genuine. Although we put athletes on a pedestal and make them superheroes, sometimes they are just simple humans just like you and I.   \n  \nThe struggles or traumatic moments were most real: Especially the passing of Jimmy Bulter's father and his subsequent season ending injury made (for me at least) one of the more hard hitting moments in the series. I think Jimmy Butler was the most interesting player they followed. His passion for the game, the ability to not take himself so seriously, his interests in wine, music, dominos and his quirky humour all added to this. \n\nThis series maybe didn't showcase the best side for Anthony Edwards: Although it is understood he is a big kid type of personality he felt pretty 'immature' when it came to his life outside basketball (even though he grew up a lot during the series with the birth of his little girl). To be fair he's only 22 during filming (23 now) so maybe that's too much to ask of him. He's definitely a superstar and one of the next faces of the NBA. Plus he does seem like a nice guy who hasn't lost his roots with his family and his hometown (Atlanta). \n\nSince they had a bunch of nice guys it would be good to have some variation to follow a Michael Jordan/Kobe Bryant like player who was 100% all in basketball and nothing else: Someone who is just a ruthless assassin on/off the court. All the players worked hard in the series on their craft but would be fun to see a kind of 'mental' player who was pushing themselves to the limit every day. \n\nWe will miss Lebron when he is done: Although Lebron gets a lot of hate, I think we will all miss him when he leaves this game. The guy has basically exceeded all expectations and even though the series may be 'manicured' but I believe he's a pretty good father/family man as well.\n\nIf they had a season 2 I would suggest the following 5 players to follow:   \n  \n- Victor Wembanyama: His life must be crazy as a 'generational talent' rookie whom lives up the hype.  \n- Steph Curry: He's definitely one of the GOATs (especially as a PG and shooter) and would be fun to know more about his life as he is the winter of his career. His Olympic 'night night' performance during the gold medal game was one of the most memorable moments in this year's Olympics.   \n- Giannis Antetokounmpo: After winning a championship a few years ago and could document his climb back to the top. He's definitely a hard worker MJ/Kobe mentality type.   \n- Jaylen Brown: One of the smartest guys in the NBA. Love to learn more about him. Bit of a redemption storyline of winning the NBA championship but was left off Team USA.   \n- Nikola Jokić: He just seems like a bit of a 'wacky' and potentially funny guy with his interests outside basketball (like his horses) and interesting how he doesn't fit the typical NBA MVP mould.\n\nClearly there are other worthy players as well but I thought these would be quite interesting. \n\nWhat did you like or dislike about the series?",

I also started watching TWD around the same time as I started watching Black Summer, and I’ll be honest, I’m not really feeling it. However, I know I tend to not like some things at first, but enjoy them later if I push through or start a rewatch. \n\nI’m generally curious about the following things:\n\n1) Do the campy horror vibes go away at any point? I do appreciate some camp where it’s well placed, but it feels like it takes itself too seriously at some points.\n\n2) Do the action sequences stay the same? They’re so much fun and about the only thing I enjoy about the show so far! Love the long shots.\n\n3) Do the characters get fleshed out anymore? How long does it take? I do enjoy that characters like Sun and Randy are kind of forced to figure things out (Sun knowing like no English is a really interesting perspective)\n\n4) How long does it take for the groups to actually get together?\n\n5) Do the vignette cuts go away? I can understand the vibe they’re going for, but it feels kind of redundant to cut to a title screen for every perspective shift, especially when it’s all part of the same sequence or not a drastic change in location or character. \n\n6) Do we actually get to see more zombies/any signs of the mass destruction and assumed bombing we hear at the beginning? That sounds sick as hell and I’d really like something to look forward to. Plus I think at this point in the show, despite all the chaos, I’ve only seen… nine zombies? Are there more? \n\nAnd bonus:\n\n7) Depending on all of this, aside from TWD, what zombie media would you recommend? (Have seen Cargo, 28 Days Later, World War Z, Living Dead movies. Also refuse to watch Resident Evil because I love the games too much to subject myself to that)",

They had the scoops for a long time there, and idk what happened, if they sold it to someone else or change the management teams or what, but they've lost the plot. I like most people loved Netflix, but then they started to make series and cancel after one or two seasons, but keeping garbage shows on for far too long, then came the whole password sharing debacle and you can't share an account with someone if you don't live in the same place and its just been, in my opinion, one bad decision after another. For exemple, take Grand Army, a show that had real potential, talked about important subjects and did good as when it came out it made the top ten list around the world, but they cancelled it after one season because the 3rd week the views had plummeted. Now what I think is ridiculous is that they basically invented binge watching, a show that has only 9 episodes could be binged watched in a single day, so it seems normal to me that if you binge watch it when it first comes out, like everyone does, then of course the views are gonna plummet after a few weeks. But no, sure, cancel that like so many others to keep pumping out whatever the hell Riverdale became at the end. I've come to hate netflix over the past few years, they pump out meaningless garbage because it makes money, they don't want to make actual important shows, they cancel so may shows that its useless to start a netflix series because chances are you 'll never see the end of that story. Plus, if you are a student studying far from home, they don't care if you can barely afford to survive no, now you can't be on your parents account you have to pay for your own. At this point is it even worth it ? I haven't used the platform in maybe 2 years now because I'd rather deal with the risk of viruses and relentless ads of streaming online than give my money to a company that just wants to pump out stuff to make more and more money.

Since we weren't in the same household, I had my own email (in the format of FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@gmail.com) to use and I could watch Netflix with her account since they were cracking down on password sharing. \n\nThen in June 2024, I bought a PS5 and to my surprise it came with a free year of Netflix that I didn't even know was part of it. That was nice so I removed myself from my sister's plan and got on the new free year of Netflix. Only issue was for some reason the email with the dot in the name wasn't working to redeem my free year of Netflix. I guess it turns out that since it was an extra account not in the household that it wasn't able to be redeemed or whatever. I'm still not sure. But since I have Gmail, I was able to just remove a dot in my email (FIRSTNAMELASTNAME@gmail.com) and anything acct related would still go to the same inbox. I ended up doing that and now I've got my own Netflix, but unfortunately all the history I had with the other Netflix acct didn't save so I have to start fresh.\n\nIt may seem pointless since it's all resolved now, but what I want to do is change my current Netflix to the email with the dot. I try to do that and it says there's an acct already in use. I log in to that acct and there's no place to actually delete the email completely and I fear deleting the entire acct altogether would remove all my history and I'm hoping I can get the history back. If not, then it's fine. But does anyone have any resolution on how to change my email or just leave it be and carry on?\n\nTL;DR: I was using my sister's Netflix account with an email that had a dot (FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@gmail.com), but after getting a free year of Netflix with my PS5, I switched to the dotless version of my Gmail. Now I'm trying to switch back to the dotted email, but Netflix says it's already in use, and I'm worried about losing my viewing history if I delete the account with the dot. I'm looking for a way to change the email without losing my history or wondering if I should just leave it as is.",

But then I started wondering, this is way back before the Internet, how would the mom have found these people who would want to engage in something like that? It seems like asking around if people were into that would run a really high risk of being busted for being a creep. \n\nAnd also, what did the mom do once the boys grew up and couldn't be abused anymore? She was just done? That seems unlikely. \n\nShe's like the scum of the Earth. Why wasn't that women ever held accountable for what she did?! ",

Does anyone know Goreng’s crime that landed him in purgatory?\n\nThe only other character I can think of which received a backstory that didn’t attach an explicit crime was the interviewer lady (with the dog) in the first movie. What was her crime? Maybe her crime was landing Goreng in Purgatory when he didn’t belong? I suppose this could be a hypothesis, since she appears to be the only obvious character that started IN Purgatory (or the Purgatory waiting room) and not “our” world. \n\nAnyways, I’ve only watched each movie once, and am not a hyperanalyzing junkie on this series (besides now lol), so please feel free to correct any obvious holes in my thoughts/hypotheses. Any thoughts/wisdom on the above questions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

Kaos\n2. The Society\n3. I'm not okay with this\n4. Paranormal Park\n5. Lockwood & Co\n6. 1899\n7. Shadow and Bone\n8.

The Brothers sun (how the fuck am i on 10 already, afaik these shows were all canceled in 2023 and 2024)\\[\n11. The Midnight Club\n12. Archive 81\n13. October Faction (Edit: forgot these two as well, the list is never ending it seens)\n14. Marianne (another one i forgot)\n\nand that's about it, now how many shows i watched for the first time that got renewed? ONLY ONE, Supacell  \nand like i really liked supacell overall, but that show really feels much lower budget and maybe that is the reason it's alive, I'd say i am looking forward to it, but with this massacre i just described of shows getting axed, how am i to expect that if supacell gets even 10% more budget to maybe look a bit better its not getting cancelled in season 2? or maybe rushed to a ending in season 3?\n\nI have no confidence watching a show these days won't lead to a complete waste of time, so i'd wait for them to actually finish before watching, but if i do that they get axed instantly cause brother there is no patience on these executives it seens, nothing gets to grow more than a year in the garden of tree stumps",

It's really frustrating when we pay for a specific plan, like 4K streaming, but we're just expected to trust that everything is streaming in 4K without any real way to verify it.\n\nSure, Netflix adjusts based on internet speed, but why not give us the option to force it to stream at a particular quality? Sometimes, the image looks less than 4K even when my internet is perfectly fine. For the price we pay, I feel like there should be more transparency.\n\nIt’s even more annoying when it comes to downloads. Has anyone else noticed that the quality of \"high quality\" downloads still looks subpar? I’ve tried downloading movies and shows for offline viewing, and despite selecting the highest available quality, the video still appears blurry or pixelated, nowhere near what you'd expect from 4K.\n\nWe’re paying extra for premium quality, and it feels like we’re just being told to trust the system, even though we can’t see any real proof that we’re actually getting what we paid for. This should definitely be something Netflix addresses. Giving users the option to select their quality manually would be a huge step in the right direction. It’s not just about paying more—it’s about actually delivering the experience we’re paying for. What do you all think?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Giving this the spoiler tag just in case anyone wants to talk about the ending. \n\nI just wanted to say it was a delight to watch Culinary Class Wars. The premise was great, there were some out there characters, some big names, some undiscovered talent, all thrown in to the same competition. As an American I enjoy watching shows that show me a glimpse into other countries. I was rooting for some, thought some were a little cocky, but loved them for it. Having so many different personalities really made the show great. The judges were fair and entertaining. The food is completely out of my league but I felt like I learned a bit watching. Ultimately what put this show over the top for me, was the respect I saw each chef show one another and the passion in their work. The way they spoke about their work, their restaurants and their customers. It was beautiful to watch them come up with unique dishes, full of passion. The cherry on top were the closing words. They really moved me with the final interviews, especially the man who said he’s “been cooking non stop with no days off and I guess in a way, you could say this was proof I ever existed”. So a well done to editing and the film crew as well. ",

What is worse, I often see an advertisement for a streaming service with a certain movie or tv series in my country, which is not even available in my country, which is really frustrating.\n\nAnyway these days I feel like the restrictions are bigger than ever and sometimes the movies or tv series (Netflix OG, HBO OG...), where the platform owns the licence are not even available worldwide for no reason.\n\nI really feel like the services are not so worth of buying, specially when they dont understand its us who pays them for our entertainment and I wonder if their behaviour will bring them to the end and the piracy will come back.",

Honestly shows are kind of better for that, as after a year I’ll have forgotten the cliffhanger, and more just remember the way I felt about the show overall.\n\nCome on Netflix. Get it together, I canceled my sub, and just caught Kaos before it expired. That show had me thinking I would come back for it’s second season, and catch up on what dropped since then, but now I think I’m done unless they start doing cliffhanger-less seasons.

What are they doing at Netflix?\n\nI'll admit That 90s Show didn't catch with me until season 2 but it's still a good show and nostalgia is big right now.\n\nBut canceling Kaos?!\n\nI was hooked just watching the preview.\n\nI just don't understand their metrics for what gets canceled and doesn't. They say based on views within the first few weeks. But that's not a fair judgement. We're far past cable TV days.\n\nThere's so much to watch on tons of streaming apps, we can't possibly watch everything the day it drops especially when it's the whole season at once. Personally, when I get into a show, I stick to it until I've watched the final episode avaliable at the time. Then I move to the next show. And I just jump around every time a new season comes out.\n\nSo I may not have watched Kaos in their timely manner, but it shouldn't mark it as one to cancel. I'm sure a lot of people added it to their list, had other shows (and life!) going on and decided to get to it when they could. Because that's how streaming works.\n\nIf you want to judge by views in the first month, then you should release only a couple episodes each week. That gives incentive to watch each time an episode drops.\n\nBut instead they decide to cut great shows and keep making garbage like The Mole.. Wtf",

As my sister-in-low already has a paid subscription(premium) she can add an extra member and it is way cheaper than to buy a new one.   \nSo my  question is **can she add my existing profile's email as a new extra member?** Or should I open a new account as a new \"extra member\".   \nI hope that it is somehow possible to do so, otherwise Netflix is just forcing to delete an account and sign up a new one, and lose the whole history.    \n",

So first of all how did that old man from first part appeared again with the Perempuan??? Then, what is below level 333, that hole, what is that and who are those people there - I assume they are the people that died but it is still fucking confusing. How did she saved the boy at the end by sending him to the top? How is that going to save him? How are there kids in the platform? And also Perempuan met Goreng at the end and it's seems like they know each other? What's up with that? So yeah I know I have a lot of questions but I would love some explanation pls!!",

        "selftext": "SPOILERS AHEAD (DUH!)\n\nI just watched the Queen's Gambit. Can someone please explain to me what I'm supposed to like about this show? How did this show get such praise and approval?\n\n \n\nCharacters were poorly developed and faintly motivated. They also kept randomly popping up and reappearing out of nowhere.\n\nThe acting seemed unnatural. Clichés on top of clichés.\n\nThe chess portion – OMG… I'm someone that barely knows how all the pieces move, and I felt the way the game was portrayed was horribly uninspired. It feels like it was written by someone that never played chess, and only knows it as \"a game for smart people\", and \"oh it's so deep and only smart people understand it\". Sure, if they made it actually complex in a way that would be interesting to chess players, they would rule out like 99.9% of their audience reach, but still.\n\n \n\nI’ll continue by just rambling on about random bits and pieces:\n\n \n\nBeth's character is introduced in the first scene by being wet, and her first words are \"I'm coming\" – and if that's isn't fitting of the tone of the whole show… Her character could be summed up with three words: troubled, smart, pretty.\n\nShe’s missing at least 10-15 minutes EVERY DAY (or so it’s portrayed) cleaning the sponges while she plays with the janitor…. and no one bets an eye on it for MONTHS?\n\nBeltik just randomly re-appears out of nowhere – THREE TIMES! First when he knocks at her door and later moves in, then at the school where he says he’s concerned about her, and then at the end along with Benny helping her win over \"the Russians\".\n\nJolene also shows up OUT OF NOWHERE.\n\nHer adoptive mother: she’s on and off about being supportive with her playing chess, and then disrupting her away from it. Even when she has a financial incentive for her to succeed, she keeps interrupting her. Oh yeah, such a complex and troubled character as well. Yeah right.\n\nThat French model girl!! Omg….. \"mais oui, bein sur, je suis une modele, je suis Parisienne and je suis bisexuelle, teehee\". Oh, \"Europeans\"…… She had to be like 7 French movie tropes/clichés all in one. Barf.\n\nBorgov is a very stern and serious looking Russian character. Clichéy cliché. Are we back in the 80s?\n\nBorgov and his Russian chess pals don’t close the door when they’re discussing strategy because… PLOT??\n\nRight after \\^this scene the camera circles around the hotel and we can see inside the rooms through the windows – and the perspective is oh so bad, it is laughable. It looked like something out of a Wes Anderson movie and was so out of style for the rest of the show. Balcony scenes in Mexico City also had some poor CGI/green screen work.\n\nThat one Russian grandmaster chess player (with long hair and a bear) speaks with a… German accent? o.0\n\nAll the guys she’s beat effortlessly (or with minimal effort) are giving HER advice over the telephone on how to beat a fckin WORLD CHAMPION. She was supposedly levels above their game, and now they’re of help??\n\nTownes is “the one that got away” and the one that stole her heart because… what, he looked deep into her eyes while he was photographing her?? WTF. I thought she was gonna say Beltik or Benny when she was asked about that…. left me so confused. That felt so unexplained. But oh, she’s smart and troubled, so she is complex beyond comprehension.\n\n \n\n \n\nAll in all: totally unconvincing, and left me deflated.\n\nI'm trying to see the other perspective. What did you like about the show?",

It doesn’t waste any time introducing you to the main characters and all of them have a strong story. \n\nI’m gonna analyze the protagonist a bit more, because her journey was beautifully done. She starts out in a very vulnerable place, wanting to live a better life, to fix all imperfections which is very relatable. As she loses her childhood friend, gains a new one (I could talk about Shay for hours). As she goes on a mission and has her whole view shattered by the “Smoke”, I connected with her so well. Consistently she shows strength, compassion and stubbornness, all characteristics of a great protagonist. Her journey to believing in “Smoke” mission was really convincing, even the romance made sense. I think the performance of the actress also sold me (I didn’t know she had that much range!!). \n\nNow the story is a bit rough around the edges. It started with: what if we fixed all imperfections and then there’d be no pretty privilege? Then it was: free will vs determinism? And some stuff about climate in between? I think it only delivered on the second message, and its enough to get me invested. But there are some contradictions. If they wanted maximum control, why wait until they are 16 at all? You’re telling me some “board” has control over the entire population? Surely there must’ve been more who rebelled? How is Earth not a wasteland if the flowers doing that much damage? Anyways, it’s okay, I guess. They lose depth making the two sides black and white. And the talk on beauty standards is lost. \n\nAll in all, despite the contradictions and wasted potential the characters, the performances and the world design makes me enjoy the story.\nIt’s gonna get a sequel? Right?\n\nNETFLIX – DON’T YOU DARE CANCEL THE SEQUEL!!\n",

Apparently the only way people can watch history is if aliens and psychics are involved. \n\nNow to segue into the new Unsolved Mysteries, one of my fav docu shows ever. The new one is 5 episodes long, and only one of those episodes is about an unsolved murder. The other 4 are all the same kind of dumb fantasy aliens stuff we've heard about 100 times. Yes I realize Unsolved always had these episodes but can we keep it to like 2 of them per season for god's sake? \n\nI am not normally a complainer but I had to vent this time. ",

So this is my opinion on the show so far. My opinion has nothing to do with the story. Cause I really don't know what actually happened.\n\nSo right now I'm in the middle of episode 2. It's pretty good so far. A lot of people were making a big deal about the kiss scene. But to me, it looked like he kissed him on the corner of his mouth close to his cheek. Maybe there is another kiss and I haven't seen it yet. It definitely feels like they have a romantic connection. And yes, I know they are brothers. But everyone I've seen talk about the show, says they have a romantic connection. Which I've never seen that in a show. So I do think that is pretty interesting. Would it be interesting in real life no. But for a show, it is pretty interesting. Why are the actors so hot though? When they shot their parents, I was like Did that just happen. And obviously, I knew it was going to happen. I just didn't think it was so gruesome. I thought it would just be a regular shot. They blew their head off basically. I don't know if that is how it was in real life. I tried finding the pictures, but I really couldn't find anything. But so far I think the show is pretty good. What do you think of the show? And I'm talking about the show. Please don't try relating it to the case. I'm not very knowledgeable on what actually happened. I just found out who they were a couple months ago.",

I can't stream in 4K anymore on my Windows 11 PC via the app or the web, despite I subbed to 4K, the stream settings is set to highest possible, and no problem with the hardware setup (will be detailed below). Occassionally, the stream does come out 4K but after I stop streaming and restart streaming it goes back to 1080p.\n2. The show information is missing video quality/resolution tag, all shows doesn't tell me if it's in HD, or in UltraHD 4K. It only tells me the audio quality available (5.1, Dolby Atmos, Spatial Audio).\n\nMy setup:\n\n* Intel Core i9-10850K, 32GB, Nvidia RTX3070, Windows 11 latest stable update. Spec wise, everything checks out.\n* 2 monitor setup, 1st is 32\" 4K via DP, 2nd is 27\" 1080p via HDMI. When I'm trying to watch Netflix, I set Windows to only show on 1st display (per the rules specified by Netflix).\n* I don't see any issue with the codecs and Microsoft Edge. HDCP 2.2 support is true, HEVC 4K support is true. Microsoft Edge is on the latest stable version.\n   * [Edge About GPU Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l-iXMeWOKmJ6ccnzwL72pA1CM2e6Q8XB/view?usp=sharing)\n* Internet is 300Mbps, speed test through [fast.com](http://fast.com) does show 300Mbps. PC is connected through LAN.\n\nThings that I've done and still does not resolve my problem:\n\n* Contacted Netflix support, no resolution.\n* Reinstall HEVC plugin.\n* Clear browser history/cache/cookies.\n* Disconnect second monitor (1080p), still does not resolve.\n* Re-install Netflix app.\n\nI'm pretty sure that the issue is on my PC end as my work laptop and my phone doesn't have this problem.\n\nOn my Microsoft account, there's another old laptop that runs Windows 10 that's also having similar issue. I'm not sure if that is causing the problem? My work laptop is not logged in with the same Microsoft account.\n\nThe only 2 things that I haven't try is to uninstall Edge and do clean installation of Windows 11.  I don't know how to re-install Edge (Windows being Windows), so probably will go straight to the second option as it seems to be a lot simpler if I couldn't solve this by next week. I don't want to do clean installation if I can know for sure if it won't solve my issue, but I'm out of ideas what to do.",

This show is without a doubt one of my favorites, if not my favorite show period, what do you guys think?",

I confirmed my (iPad) device isn't supported\n4) my surface isn't a eligible device to download shows... Zero explanation as to why.\n5) I bought internet on a flight so I could watch, turns out my surface in tablet mode isn't eligible but when I have my keyboard it is... Lol \n6) I paid to upgrade my plan and magically all the previous issues are non-existent... Like just communicate \"hey these features might not work with the plan\"\n\n I don't want to beta test your product.\n\n I don't have an issue paying for the ad free viewing but restricting so many services across so many devices for the basic plan is criminal and once I finish these series Netflix will be going back on the blacklist of companies to avoid.

These things are: the fact that Muller mentioned the ex, Andrea, and said she was the intended victim. The fact that an agent on the case, David Sesma, had ties to Andrea and was allowed to remain on the case….Denise and Aaron said that more than one person was involved in this. What if it was David Sesma? \n\nWhy were David Sesma and Andrea and their ties to this case and why Muller mentioned her not investigated further, especially since it was proven that Denise and Aaron were telling the truth?\n\nThey both corroborated the same thing, that the kidnapper said: “This was meant for Andrea.” How did Muller know about Andrea, and was it possible he was sent to that home by someone else? I think these are very valid questions.  \n\nAny thoughts about this?",

It would be nice if it could somehow keep track of some of the shows I've already seen instead of suggesting the same stuff I've already watched. My biggest complaint though is trying to search for new shows the fact that they do not come up easily some of them come up but not the complete list.

        "title": "Thoughts on “Mr. McMahon”",
        "selftext": "When it was announced that Netflix would be producing a documentary covering the life and times of controversial wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, there was a healthy dose of skepticism. \n\nFirstly, Netflix was entering a partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the pro wrestling behemoth run by McMahon for decades and in his family even longer. It was easy to presume that they’d take it easy on the company and the man at its helm so as to not rock the boat and sour their new relationship. Secondly, McMahon himself would be participating in the documentary, and as a man famous for his need to control the narrative surrounding his public persona, another wrinkle presented itself. How vulnerable would he allow himself to be? How much of what goes behind the curtain, so to speak, would he be willing to divulge?\n\nAs it turns out, not much. A lengthy portion of this limited series is spent recounting less the story of Vince the Man— we only briefly touch on his noted turbulent upbringing— and more the story of Vince the Promoter. And that’s fine. I myself am a passionate pro wrestling fan— even when I’m not actively watching the product, I’m consuming all the latest news surrounding same. So many of the subjects here, which span from the death of the territories to the Benoit family tragedy and all that it wrought— are familiar grounds to me, and others at my level of fandom. But for the casual viewer, this oral history of sorts may prove to be enlightening viewing, given personality by the many larger-than-life talking heads present and their sometimes contradictory recounting of events.\n\nApart from that, though, there really isn’t much here that makes it essential viewing, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t walk out of this one slightly disappointed, and that’s down to two things. Firstly, the premise. Titling the doc itself Mr. McMahon brings to mind not Vince the Man, or even Vince the Promoter— rather, Vince the Onscreen Character. In doing so, the doc makes its mission clear: highlight both the former and lattermost “versions” of McMahon, and draw a connective throughline between them. How much of the character is exaggeration? How much of it reflects the very real, very flawed human being who portrays him? With McMahon being noted for his various quirks and eccentricities, coupled with his ruthless business practices, what you have is a rich concept for an exploratory biographical piece.\n\nSecondly, the marketing. As stated in the doc, much of it was filmed and edited prior to the bombshell allegations of sexual misconduct levied against McMahon being made public, so it can be assumed that the series didn’t start off with the aim of exposing him as it did to paint a portrait of a complex titan of industry. Once those accusations did come out, however, they would be forced to pivot. Whether it be by their own hand, or by the WWE’s, who one can surmise would think it best they distance themselves from McMahon as they enter the era of revitalized popularity and record profit they’re currently in. But while the marketing of the series seemed to reflect this shift in attitude, the series itself doesn’t really do much to explore this side of McMahon in any meaningful way until the second half of the final episode. Whether that be down to it being far too late into production to fully embrace the change, or just not wanting to upset their new business partner, we will never know. \n\nWhat we do know is that the result is a documentary series with worlds of potential that never really digs deep enough below the surface to extract anything substantive regarding the enigmatic figure at its center. A decent watch with some fun moments and neat historical tidbits, but nothing more.",

Plus giving the two judges the ability to bring back two chefs and they both pick black chefs ignoring the really good ones with much better techniques and experience just to even the numbers between the two teams. I was really into the show until that happened. Do you think it’s fake? ",

One thing the document didn't mention is where he worked, and that was the VA hospital  in Seattle. \n\nThe scenes you see in this episode are the location of a va hospital, which only sees veterans. I found it odd that when they said she was beaten and left for dead in the hospital  that they showed the VA hospital, considering it only takes veterans in, and its also not a trauma center. Harbor view in Seattle is more for trauma. But perhaps she was a veteran. I'm now sure I can't recall. I might have to rewatch, but I don't think I recall stating the was. \n\nI remember being in shock, thought hearing this story and being like wow. We had a monster not far from us, though. ",

There was a lot of emphasis on Will not being like his father and Tag hating Will. Plus the weirdness between Greer and Shooter and how “close” they are and how she asked him to pose for the family photo. Why else would he run during the police investigation? Or give Greer so much money? Maybe Tag felt license to step outside of his marriage after she gave birth to a teenager’s baby. I can’t possibly be the only one who thought this! Is there a season 2?",
