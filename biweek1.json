What Haneke demonstrates is that Nazis are not that special. They were children that lived through an incredibly tumultuous and painful period in German history, and as such, many grew to not have faith in anything. Their leaders, their social structure, the older generation - all failures in the eyes of the troubled, abandoned German youth.

Maybe the fascination with 3D animation started with Toy Story, i'm not sure but Mario is like my favourite 3D animated movie purely based on visuals.",

Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n> This holiday entry, which could almost have been called A Fast & Furious Christmas, is so ugly, artificial and overlong that it should cure kids of any belief in magic. It’s a prime example of the ways in which CG effects have impoverished the imaginations of many contemporary filmmakers — making anything possible, but too often at the expense of a human heartbeat. In any case, Red One is the equivalent of a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-christmas-1236054244/)\n\n> I’m not sure that a Hollywood movie has ever kicked off the season with less true Christmas spirit than “Red One.” Sure, J.K. Simmons plays Santa Claus (who gets abducted), and Simmons is winning in his crinkly old wise innocence. Dwayne Johnson, as Santa’s bodyguard (who wants to retire because he’s having a crisis of faith), is his outsize amiable self. The odd thing about the movie is that while it’s a little bit tongue-in-cheek, it’s not really a comedy. Directed with charmless energy by Jake Kasdan, “Red One” is at once an action movie; a kidnap-rescue thriller in which the doors to supply closets in toy stores are mystic portals; and an exercise in Christmas world-building, as if that’s the thing that’s been missing from Christmas.\n\n-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-hemsworth-j-k-simmons-1236199619/)\n\n> “Red One” will make you not only bummed about the holidays ahead, but about cinema’s future as well. Yet if you’ve been paying attention (and wasting your money at multiplexes in the process), the latter’s a reality far less shattering than the dawning of Santa Claus’s own upon a hopeful child. Make it a Christmas miracle, and cross this “Red One” off your list.\n\n-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-1235062639/): D\n\n> Yes, it’s cheesy, but this movie is best when it leans heavily into the cheese. If that makes your eyes roll, keep in mind this is a Christmas movie ultimately intended for kids who’ve made it all the way through the MCU on Disney+ twice and their parents now need a reprieve. There are still some jokes aimed at the cold-hearted adult who will inevitably be dragged along on the family cinema outing.\n\n-[Glenn Garner, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/11/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-1236165948/)\n\n> The most important thing I can tell you about Jake Kasdan’s “Red One” is that yes, it’s a real film starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans as a mismatched action movie odd couple rescuing a kidnapped Santa Claus, and not a “Saturday Night Live” parody. And it’s not nearly as awful as it sounds.\n\n-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-christmas-movie/)\n\n> There’s nothing wrong with a big-hearted film for Christmas, but this commercial and formulaic slice of content is a toy destined to be forgotten, not by Boxing Day, but mid-November.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/06/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-santa-kidnapped): 1/5\n\n> Most disappointing of all is that there’s a moment right out of the incredible scene at the start of 2010’s The Other Guys, when Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson leap off a tall building in pursuit of suspects as though their swagger will save them, only to splat on the pavement and die. In Red One, Johnson does the exact same thing unironically, diving off Santa’s tower after his captors, then swinging off other structures and finding his way into a snowmobile-chase sequence. It doesn’t look like there’s room for that kind of self-deprecation in Johnson’s career anymore.\n\n-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-netflixs-red-one-will-remind-you-of-better-movies.html)\n\n> The movie's shining light is JK Simmons as a muscly Santa who can easily do 500 press-ups in five minutes. He manages to sell the schmaltzy lines and is a great fit as Saint Nick in his second Santa movie outing following Netflix's exceptional Klaus. Unfortunately, the plot means he's off-screen after the first act and the movie suffers for it. You're also left with an overwhelming confusion over who Red One is actually aimed at. The humour is largely too juvenile for adults, but the language is also too crude for young ones. Even the villain Grýla (a wasted Kiernan Shipka, who mostly just glares at the camera) is likely too scary for the youngest viewers.\n\n-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a62801725/red-one-review/): 2/5\n\n> A simpler adventure might have amplified that feel-good message, but Red One, which reportedly cost $250 million, lumbers over its two-hour runtime. The story introduces other fantastical organisations — Liu plays the director of a group that monitors magical figures — and even checks in on Santa’s coldhearted brother Krampus (Kristofer Hivju). The slathered-on CGI is often unsightly, and Shipka rarely gets a moment to shine. Still, Simmons makes for an endearing, unironic Santa whose passion for his job has never wavered. At its best, Red One embodies that lightness, balancing it with the overwhelming dictates of a big-budget spectacle — but not nearly often enough. \n\n-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/red-one-review/5198830.article): 2/5\n\n> Making a truly classic Christmas movie is hard; despite a slew of new ones every year, the last crop of true classics date back to 2003. But you still have to approach them with genuine goodwill in your heart, not some focus-group scores and aspirations of a shared holiday universe. If this had just reined in the bombast and focused on the characters, it might have been something. As it is, it’s an awfully big box for such a small amount of cheer.\n\n-[Helen O'Hara, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/red-one/): 2/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nWhen Santa Claus is kidnapped, Callum Drift, the head of North Pole security, must team up with Jack O'Malley, a bounty hunter, to find and rescue him.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nJake Kasdan\n\n**WRITER**\n\nChris Morgan (story by Hiram Garcia)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nHenry Jackman\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nDan Mindel\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nMark Helfrich, Steve Edwards & Tara Timpone\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\n- November 8, 2024 (UK, Mexico and a few other markets)\n\n- November 15, 2024 (United States and rest of the world)\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n123 minutes\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n$250 million\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Dwayne Johnson as Callum Drift\n\n- Chris Evans as Jack O'Malley\n\n- Lucy Liu as Zoe Harlow\n\n- J.

The movie grossed 1300 crores or 170 million USD which is one of the highest grossing films in India. What was unexpecting about the movie's popularity in India was that this movie also became a hit in USA, Canada and Japan which was really surprising and shocking as many celebrities around the world were praising this movie badly calling it a eye candy and visual spectacle etc.\n\nAn example would be James Cameron and Steven Spielberg who both met the director of RRR SS Rajamouli in some Hollywood function and praised the movie.\n\n[SS Rajamouli and Steven Spielberg](https://preview.redd.it/y24jqr5ew9zd1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dbc8444f6e4360c4d596c594a7971875aefcac4)\n\n[James Cameron and SS Rajamouli](https://preview.redd.it/0nducgchw9zd1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=07c0fbfbbc1b15bb0d34a4a692aa0ea9a1cedeb0)\n\nThe movie also won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for the best original Song Naatu Naatu which was one of the most popular songs in 2022 India. Also the movie won many other awards around USA states becoming a rare Indian movie to do so because no other Indian movie has reached this level of popularity in USA and the west as RRR did. RRR also was the only Indian movie to win a golden globe award and an Oscar for the best original song.\n\n[RRR oscar for best original song](https://preview.redd.it/sm7ybx4tw9zd1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7104ad4d3d5800f1a29ae2301a197b93760a7f4)\n\nThere were also many reactions from many youtubers and reviewers as well as many American audience calling it the best movie of 2022.\n\nSo I was wondering what do average American and Canadian think of RRR and its popularity.\n\nWhat amazed you about the movie and why so many people found this movie special although I really liked the movie myself and enjoyed binge watching RRR however what I'm really surprised is the western popularity of RRR because there were few people of India who called RRR average or ok movie although I personally disagree with the few people in India who disliked RRR but the west response was unexpected?",

I would have loved to talk to people afterwards to see if they were willing to share more about what they thought about the early days of cinema. \n\nI didn't think Damien Chazzelle could create an informative and telling tale about the early cinema that was R rated and ran for 3 hours long and had a stupendously roaring loud screenplay to go with it but that's exactly what he did with Babylon.\n\nMargot Robbie plays a triumphant Harley Quinn-like character who never stops ****ING up things in her life, Diego Calva in the first movie I have ever seen him in, stands out as a capable leading man who's entertaining to watch and Brad Pitt plays a established Hollywood star who's ready to be replaced much like DiCaprio's character in Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood. \n\n8.5/10 an often times cartoonish attempt to capture the wild roaring essence of the well, roaring '20s that falls flat in trying to be scary and nuanced at so many turns but when it works, it's magic. \n\n\nSimilar movies: I saw a bit of \"Moulin Rouge\" in the movie's first party scene and the narrative setup feels carried on or atleast inspired from Once Upon a Time in.... Hollywood.\n\nLeaving question: What is your fav Damien Chazzelle ending? ",

        "selftext": "I watched Indiana Jones The Dial Of Destiny after reaching online streaming platforms and honestly speaking, the movies turned out to be fine although its not great or the best but its still entertaining and has good moments. The action sequence although cliche, still are engaging and fun to watch. Also the introduction scene and the de-aging wasn't that bad although they could have added a bit of beard and modified his voice using AI to de age his voice as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfw4yvr1r9zd1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=8698eaa23b08c2390731586c94faf19d026ebeeb\n\nThe downsides for me were probably the ending which felt really rushed and kind of cringe. There was also a character that really annoyed me which was Helena as she was super annoying with her mannerism and attitude.\n\nOther stuff were ordinary and nothing special, the VFX and CGI are standard as well, the cinematography was decent, the various locations and places were pretty decent although nothing special due to being exposed to past action adventure and past Indie series.\n\nThe villain characters were ok but not great or intimidating in any way though. The BGM and music were decent nothing great but nothing bad either.\n\nSome of the supporting characters were good though and some of them dying were kinda emotional. The story was interesting especially about the Archimedez Dial and the ability to time travel which was very interesting and intriguing to watch.\n\nThe budget of the movie was close to 300 million USD according to many sources and the film does not like a 300 million USD movie since the VFX and CGI were ordinary and standard. The underwater scene clearly and obviously looked CGI to me so I do not understand where major portions of the money had gone to for this movie.\n\nOverall this movie was a decent watch although its not great or unique but it was still worth a watch atleast for those who like entertainment and fun. I don't get why so much hate and is the movie really that horrible for many people?\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this movie and is it really that bad?",

I have to say one of the most beautiful things is when you stumble upon a movie, or a group of movies of a certain genre or with a certain actor or a certain director that you’d never seen but just totally click with you. Sometimes you get in ruts where every movie seems like a reiteration of a previous one and it feels so refreshing when you find something new that feels different.\n\nThis happened with me and Albert Brooks movies. I only knew him from finding Nemo and this is 40 and can’t believe what I’ve been missing. I saw broadcast news and loved that movie tremendously and specifically his character. His sense of humor and anxiety and his self deprecation just hit the sweetest spot for me and so I sought out more. I watched Defending Your Life, Modern Romance, and Real Life. Similar but different I was also recommended the Big Chill based on this interest and loved that one so much I bought the dvd right after. \n\nI have two questions:\n\n1. Have you experienced this? If so what was the movie, actor, director, etc.?\n\n2. I was born in the 90s and missed the bulk of these 80s movies and was wondering if you had any suggestions for movies similar to these Albert Brooks ones I mentioned and the big chill?\n\nAppreciate you all and happy watching!",

He's way too close to his best friend being honest with her complementing her half dressed body, being way too intimate with her all while he's engaged to a woman, he clearly doesn't seem to know well enough. It seems like they're still in the honeymoon stages of love, not to mention she can't even legally drink. She's 20 and he's 28. Personally, I do think this is an appropriate age gap. But that aside, he's completely okay with her giving up her career in future to follow him around in his crappy job because of his ego? And then when she tries to change your mind about this, which I understand he's upset, it's last minute, but he basically gaslights her into being submissive and complicit to him??? \nThe thing that I don't get is why no one acknowledges michael as the villain? From what i've seen, everyone just seems so caught up with the fact that julianne doesn't end up with michael in the end and thinks it's subversive, but I think michael is the real villain? But I can't find any information of I guess other people agreeing. So my question is when it first came out. Did anyone else think that Michael was the villain? When rewatching it, did people feel that way? I feel like all the focus was on julianne.And michael, just kind of gets a pass for being shitty. \nI just feel like when you rewatch certain movies that you saw as a kid when you're older and you see how problematic, they can be kind of how like I used to like the movie ghosts of a girlfriend's past and then I rewatched it as an adult and was concerned.

Still, those weren't good reasons for her to turn into a black widow. \n\nBy the end, I did expect a possible twist, an indication she might be guilty. It never happened.

I don’t care about the genre.  For example, I just watched Spirited Away and will watch Princess Mononoke for the first time. My husband recommends I watch Shawshank Redemption. We are also really into shows like Peaky Blinders, Silo, Severance, The Penguin. I will watch anything if it’s good EXCEPT FOR extremely disturbing grotesque things, especially about children (I just had a baby).

        "selftext": "\"Desert power.\"\n\n\n\nDune review\n\nFair warning, this is a rewatch. When I first watched the movie with a friend, I thought of it as a beautiful, visually immersive experience that I felt would be much better experienced If i knew more about the book. And that was sadly, all I thought about it at that moment.\n\n\n\nWhenever a movie starts with a Part One in it's title, I get a hesitation. And Dune's only covering one half of the FIRST book. This was going to be slow, this was going to have a lot of filler, this was going to have information and scenes that are not at any point integral to the main story and it won't be very pretty because they would save most of the budget for the second film. These were my initial thoughts when I set down to watch it again, having long forgotten most of the plot of the movie from before.\n\nDune was nothing like that. Dune is probably the best science-fiction movie I have seen this year. It is beautiful first of all, the movie somehow manages to balance shots of nature and shots of sci-fi tech and really mixes them well together to create a very immersive setting. I was in awe when Paul walks away from the beach with a ship in the background rising from the water.\n\n\n\nIt's also a really fucking compelling movie. Even though this is all serious hard science fiction stuff, there is no point in the movie where you feel lost or confused. It just works and you immediately know what each character thinks and feels. The transition from the novel to film feels very smooth in that regard though I have never read the book haha\n\nDune sounds really cool too, the soundtrack has this rhythmic thumping to it that just sounds so good and the soundtrack is appropiately quite, kicking in only at intense moments. The ships sound cool as hell\n\nThis is a pretty long movie, probably the longest I have seen in a while at 2h 35m but I wasn't bored for a single second because it has a very engaging pace and you get treated to a piece of lore or a beautiful shot of landscape in-between some really exciting fight and action sequences.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would give this movie a highly recommended even if you have never seen a science movie 9/10\n\n\n\nP/S: What's with the fight scenes? They were the only distracting bits to me and why I don't give it a perfect score. They just feel....forcefully quiet.",

        "selftext": "One of the things I find fascinating about this film is that it's message doesn't change but how that message is interpreted seems to change depending on what generation you are in. It's obviously a very political movie and it's interesting to see how everyone on either side of the political divide watch this film and think the movie is \"on their side\".\n\nI've heard folks who are more conservative comment on the medical experimentation, controlled language and lockdowns and say that is proof they are the films audience. Simultaneously on the other end of the political spectrum, those liberal folks look at that story of the young woman who was next to V's cell in the containment facility and think it validates their beliefs.\n\nIt's bizarre how nuanced storytelling has fallen to the wayside these days and everything needs to be polarizing because everyone wants to be validated. Ironically on both sides, they ignore the very first speech V gives at the TV station where he says \"if you're looking for someone to blame, you need only look in the mirror\". This couldn't be more true today as it was back then. He didn't fault one group of people for the state of affairs because it's everyone's responsibility to recognize when an idea has evolved into extremism, regardless of your political view. Even more ironic, is the idea that blowing up parliament was sticking it to one side or another, especially when you consider Guy Fawkes was catholic and by today's standards would be considered very conservative yet that's the mask V chose to wear. The man himself or any label attached to him was irrelevant, the idea is what was important.\n\nWe've forgotten that people are more than these labels we choose to attach to them. We've become so obsessed with putting ourselves in these categories, but labels by their definition are \"exclusive\". Anyone who doesn't fall under that label is automatically an outsider and it's gotten to the point where we've just stopped listening to each other altogether and stopped caring about each other. The opening monologue of the film underscores where we are really well...\"you cannot kiss an idea, you cannot touch it or hold it...ideas don't love\". I guess we'll all have to ask ourselves whether it's worth it in the end.",

        "selftext": "Had the urge to watch every Paranormal Activity movie since I never watched 5,6,7. So I watched them all in order. Extremely fun horror movies. Id honestly say they are all close to each other besides Ghost Dimension and Next of Kin. Personally Id rank them. ( 2,1,3,4,5,7,6 ). The one thing I gathered is that they did a really good job tying the movies together.\n\nPA 2: definitely the best and scariest all around. The most well made, ties into the first one nicely. The staircase scene is terrifying as well as the Kitchen explosion. The ending is slightly underwhelming but is fine. \n\nPA: The Original holds up well. gives you just enough information to make your imagination go. simple and straight to the point. Fuck Micah though. I do wish there was a few more Tobi encounters, a shadow or two. But In this franchise its just hard to beat the original. \n\nPA 3: Not many prequels do franchises justice but they did a great job with the story. The ending was what did it for me. I knew the grandmother was part of something when she mentioned trying to have a son to the mother. But when Julie doesn’t return and Denis slowly starts to find out about the Occult the movie switches a gear. \n\nPA 4: Is the middle ground. The marked ones and 4 are interchangeable. Theres nothing ground breaking about 4 but theres nothing bad about it either. Realizing Katie is the mother was a jump scare. And again the ending was intense. \n\nThe Marked ones: I loved it. It was refreshing to get away from Katie at least relatively. I know I keep talking about the endings but this ending was WILD. Not only the shotgun scene and the Grandmothers ranch, but going through the portal door to tie into the first movie was insane! Id put this movie higher but I just thought the other movies before it were a little better. \n\nNext of Kin: ill just start by saying this would be a better movie if it wasnt part of the Paranormal franchise. It was a great Found Footage film. but just not a great addition to the franchise. Beautiful cinematography. Some really good “oh shit” moments. Finding the computer closet, and the conversation with the mailman. My biggest gripe is that The movie broke away from being Found Footage twice and I just couldnt look past it. \n\nGhost Dimension: ………felt like a direct to DVD movie. The CGI was terrible and distracting. The monster reveal was extremely underwhelming. I wanted Tobi to be more demonic paimon looking. Some concepts were cool. The part where they find out they were set up and lured to buy that house was scary. When they realized the real estate agent was part of the cult made me say “oh shit”. ",

It has some real acting depth (Tim Robbins, Giancarlo Esposito, Gore Vidal, Alan Rickman and many others - even a turn by a young Jack Black). It even includes an attempted assassination that the candidate milks for sympathy. In the movie, Roberts is a folk singer who sings songs on the campaign trail, but the songs are all right-wing oriented. Rumor has it in real life that Robbins refused to release the soundtrack independently lest it be used for right-wing purposes in real life. Although the movie is over 30 years old, it speaks to the soullessness of politics in a way that is still very relatable.",

        "selftext": "I just watched *Anora*, and there are some aspects I really liked, but thinking back on it, I have a thousand questions (warning: lots of spoilers ahead, sorry!).\n\nFirst, the positives  \nMikey Madison’s performance as Anora is magnetic. She completely commands the scenes, standing out in a setting where culturally, we’re used to seeing her type of character as submissive or a victim.\n\nBut then… the inevitable “dream of marriage”  \nAbout 30 minutes in, we realize that Anora’s ultimate dream is still, well, love. From the start of her relationship, it’s clear she’s starting to get attached. This brings us back to a kind of predictable storyline in the end.\n\nHints of *Parasite* and *Triangle of Sadness*, a bit predictable too  \nAnother thing that left me puzzled was the very (too?) obvious influence of recent films like *Parasite* and *Triangle of Sadness*. The film uses certain scenes to highlight the social divide, with a whole “army of underlings” serving a detestable, spoiled teenager. The vomit scene, for example, feels almost like a copy-paste from *Triangle of Sadness* without bringing anything new to it. It loses impact and almost seems like a convenient excuse to highlight money, sex, and drugs.\n\nAnd finally, my last point—why is the director trying to make us like Igor??  \nOne of the aspects that really bothered me was this attempt to make us sympathize with Igor. In the theater, people were laughing during scenes where Anora is mistreated, and I don’t really understand what the director was trying to convey here. I found it strange that we’re invited to feel empathy for Igor, as if the message is, “Okay, he’s violent at first, but deep down he’s a good guy.” The message seemed questionable to me.\n\nAny thoughts on the film?",

Not only the Best Pixar film ever made, but also the Best Disney movie ever made, and the Best Superhero/Comicbook movie ever made (well, okay, it wasn't based on a pre-existing comic, but you get what I mean).\n\nYeah, I think it's that good, I used to rewatch this film so much when I was a kid. The film has the perfect balance of tones, it can be action packed and exciting, comedic and fun, but it also be very dark and emotional and dramatic, the Dramatic aspects landing especially well. The animation surprisingly well. This film is 20 years old and it looks better then some animated films released today, and Michael Giccahino's musical score and Brad Bird amazing direction help in that ten fold.\n\nWhile one could argue the film is just the \"Bob Parr Show\" I think it still does a great job at developing the other characters, including the other members of the family, but yeah, Bob's characterization and arc in this movie is still very great as well, in fact, it's kindof why I was hoping for a while Brad Bird would do MCU Spider-Man 4, as I feel The Incredibles, mainly Bob's arc, proved he would've done Peter's arc in that film in strodes, and the film follows the three act structure perfectly and beautifully. Don't even get me started on how awesome of a villain Syndrome is. Or how surprisingly dark and heavy the film can get, or how quotable the film is.\n\nThis is not just my favorite Superhero movie of all time, and deserves all the love it can get, but is also Disney and Pixar's Best film is general. As well as Brad Bird's best film in general.",

I am not learned enough to know if there are fancy special effects being used but from the look of it, they seem minimal. And that is what I really like about it.

The sound of the engine, the shots from the distance, the actors' reaction shots, and of course the European locations, all combine to create a sense of this not being your typical Hollywood big budget movie. \n\nMost of you have probably seen the film or at least the chase scene but I'm including a link to it below for those who havn't. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxxH0lZSYgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxxH0lZSYgU)\n\nSo, what are your favorite action sequences?\n\n",

        "selftext": "Greetings,\n\nChalchitra Darpan is an undergraduate film journal by Celluloid, the Film Society of Miranda House, University of Delhi. As Delhi University’s only undergraduate film journal, the inaugural edition (2019-20) was introduced with the vision of building a student community of future film scholars around it. The journal aims to provide an academic space for undergraduates interested in film and media, who wish to explore and engage in film academia. \n\nThe fourth edition of Chalchitra Darpan (2023-24), is in now in the making with the theme : ‘Do Films Lie?’\n\nIt is an attempt to probe and explore the portrayal of truth in cinematic storytelling, the degree to which narratives can be framed and de-framed to reveal the film’s perception of truth. The issue of the invocation of creative liberty is to be weighed against distortions of reality. There is philosophical scope herein to even examine the inherent value attributed to truth (the debatability of its existence) and realism. We may refer to the origin of dramatic irony in Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex wherein the audience and the characters are privy to different levels of information which brings forth the question of the existence of different perceptions of the same narrative. Besides the propagation of “propaganda” films such as Triumph of the Will (1935) which employ grandiose visuals and stirring speeches to create a glorified image of the Nazi regime, there is also the credibility of the category of documentaries and the matter of truth in literary cinematic adaptations, the question of ‘Do Films Lie’ leaves ample room for contemplation. \n\nChalchitra Darpan accepts a variety of written pieces for submission, such as Essays for our ‘Features’ section, which should be between 5,000-7,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography), Shorter articles of approximately 1,000-3,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography), Book Reviews, which are typically 1,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography) and Interview, with no more than 10 questions. \n\nProposal abstracts should be limited to 250 words and must be accompanied by an indicative bibliography. A brief biography of the author of approx. 150 words should be provided along with the abstract. Abstracts should be sent through as Word Documents  and titled “For consideration: Author First name Author Surname_Type of Submission” (e.g. For consideration: Mary Poppins_Videon Essay).\n\nProposals should be mailed to- chalchitradarpan@gmail.com\n\nAbstract deadline- 25th November, 2024\n\nRefer to the Concept Note for more details :[Chalchitra Darpan Concept Note 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tmpBDro2oD_3W5dyoVLJK81vxz4rosm3/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFor further queries contact us at chalchitradarpan@gmail.com\n",

At the beginning it shows a very real depiction of drowning, and by the end it has the final character who survives holding her breath and appearing on a beach where a couple is like “where the heck did this girl even come from?” It was pretty dark, but that was because it was realistic tbh.

        "title": "My feelings on the Uglies movie, as someone who read the books multiple times as a teen and just reread them last week",
        "selftext": "I am so disappointed because this series of books is excellent. It was hugely impact full on me as a teen, and I loved them so many times I read them over and over. \n\nWhen I saw that the movie had finally come out, I decided to reread them. I have been waiting for this movie for over 15 years. \n\nI know that highly anticipated media often struggles to meet expectation, but this is just.. *sigh*\n\n1. The brutality sci-fi architecture. While not explicitly explained in the books, I felt it to be too sterile in uglyville. This is a minor complaint. \n\n2. The introduction of Shay feels.. bad. Wrong? She was never mean to Tally like that in the books. Yes, uglies buly each other but it's not ao mean. \n\n3. Tally and Peris never had a romance thing between them. Ever. Peris was always only a friend. I have no idea why this seemed to be a storyline at all. Why? Pointless change. \n\n4. Introducing Dr. Cable as governor of the city + Laverne Cox casting: full miss. Dr Cable is not the governor of the city. This is, again, a needless deviation that doesn't add anything to the movie. \n\nI like Laverne Cox as an actor, she was great in OITNB and incredibly dynamic. However, she was a huge miss for me on this movie. She's over exaggerating \"serving\" to a cringe point. She's stiff, but not in the \"cruel pretty\" or \"wolfish\" way that Dr. Cable is meant to be. It's just a complete mischaracterization that is very distracting. It feels over acted and comically bad. \n\n5. I forgot to mention - the beginning of the movie. Why the hell is so much explanatory content smashed into a small montage? And it's like, badly done. AND wrong. In the books, what destroys the Rusties is an oil virus that attacks anything made of petroleum and makes it explosive. This caused an immediate, swift, and violent destruction of society. The white weed is also portrayed incorrectly. The white weed was bioengineered to be able to grow in different climates, and subsequently took over and choked out all plant life. It was not, and was never a power source or something that forces people to live in cities. What the fuck does that even mean? \n\n6. Tally's reason for leaving to find Shay + burning the weed: the reason why changing the white weed plot line is so detrimental is because it fundamentally changes the story. In the book, the cities are actually trying to maintain the planet, not destroy it with this weed. They are the ones who send out rangers to burn it to prevent it from spreading, which makes this whole scene with David flying a helicopter (when the fuck did David become a helicopter pilot y'all) so fucking dumb. Tally is told that The Smoke is destroying the planet with their clearcutting and burning trees and hunting. Tally leaves because she is told she will remain ugly forever. \n\n7. Changing the directions to The Smoke: again, a needless plot change. Why? What was wrong eith the original? It was just as interesting, why would it need to be changed at all? And when Tally is in the woods on her way, she starts a fire. That is one of the MAIN THINGS that are taboo in the books, LOL. Like????\n\n8. David is never the leader of the smoke. He never gives a big speech about how they're all revels against the city. The Smoke is, originally, just a small band of people living their lives away from the city. It's not until later that they become rebels. And even then, David is not \"the leader.\" There is never any weapon they want to use to take out cities. \n\n9. Middle pretties are supposed to have a confident wiseness about them. Whoever the actor is for the nurse in the hospital looks like she just came off of a porn set. Middle pretties are supposed to be beautiful, but in a subtle, less flashy, reassuring way. Not.. porny. \n\n10. Specials sending scouts never happened. The only time the Specials came was when called or alerted by trackers. It's another weird storyline twist to make them seem evil while at the same time doing it in a comedic supervillain way. \n\n11. The cure is never defined as a weapon, and it isn't something widely known. The cities don't really know it exists until Pretties. There isn't an element of the cure missing that Maddy needs to find. \n\n12. The Pretty population is too rambunctious. Yes, pretties have a lot of parties. But they're more vapid and aloof. The operation is even referred to as the \"bubblehead\" operation. They're docile, placcid. They are characterized wrong. \n\n13. Peris is never a special. This is such a weird and wild deviation. Dr. C isn't looking for David. There's never this big confrontation with everyone watching. The entire sequence of the Specials coming is completely wrong. Peris absolutely does not kill Az, and that doesn't happen at The Smoke. He isnt killed as a revenge tactic or to get David to come out. Hes killed in a medical experiment gone wrong. Tally is not called out in front of the entire Smoke, and David doesn't learn about her betrayal until later. \n\n14. The entire \"rescue\" sequence just had me rolling my eyes, honestly. It's like whoever wrote the script just wrote a 10x worse version of what happened. Like if you played a game of telephone and told someone the whole plot and they had to regurgitate it to you but they missed every key detail. \n\n15. Again with the evil Peris. I don't even know what to say about that one, it's just so incredibly bad, and a wild misscharacterization for what? For WHAT? Does it even add anything to the movie except a shitty fight scene? Nope!\n\n16. What they \"needed\" for the cure was not an additional part. They needed informed consent. Why does adding an additional part of needing this ingredient so important? Again, what does it actually add to the movie? \"I'll leave you a sign\" no, that doesn't happen either. The whole point is that they smuggle the cure to her in Pretties and she writes this entire note to herself about her informed consent. It's setting up for some other wack ass plotline that's just, again, stupid. \n\n\nWhat I liked: the movie looked nice. Good soundtrack. They got the last words of the book right. \n\nTldr: put the book in a blender and pick out 3 scraps of paper and then reconstruct the entire thing into a screenplay, you'll do a better job. ",

One thing that stood out to me:\n\nMarion’s lover Sam looks strikingly similar to Norman in the opening scene. Whether or not it was intentional, it makes Marion’s (relative) trust of Norman make more sense since he looks so much like her lover. \n\nI know that was the general look/hairstyle of the time so I could be reading into it too much, but it’s a nice extra layer to an already masterful film.",

        "selftext": "Story pasted below if not familiar *not my story*\n\nMy last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs | was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.\nI met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.\nThad a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.\nOne day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade).\nI was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.\nI stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real!\nThe lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspecti and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, .... kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were \"I'm missing teeth\" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.\nat some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.\nI was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..\nI went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says.",

        "selftext": "Decades before the made The Fabelmans, in the late 1970's, Steven Spielberg wanted to do a autobiographical movie about his young adulthood in Arizona. A script was written by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale (a.k.a. The Two Bobs), who had already written 1941, which Spielberg was about to direct. But he wanted to make this movie right before that. \n\nSo, Spielberg hired the Two Bobs to script the movie, first titled \"After School\", then \"Clearwater\", and finally \"Growing Up\". Spielberg said \"It's my first vendetta film. I'm going to get back at about twenty people I've always wanted to get back at.\" \n\nThe script that the Two Bobs had written would've been an R rated comedy. Lots of swear words. Spielberg totally approved the script saying, \"I don't want to make a movie about children that's dimples or cuteness.\" The movie was gonna be shot in May of 1978 with a budget of just $1.5 million dollars. \n\nThe director of photography was gonna be Caleb Deschanel (father of Zooey and Emily), but when he read the script, he called it \"disgusting\". Apparently, that caused Spielberg to back out of the movie and not make it. \n\nBut can you imagine if he had made it? It would've been his first true, honest to God R rated movie. What do you guys think?",

        "selftext": "PLEASE, Help me like the Godfather Part II\n\nI’m only 18, which might add to the problem, idk. I found out that a cinema near me was going to screen the Godfather part II in 4k. I had never seen any one of the 3 movies, but I didn’t want to pass this opportunity up, so I watched the first one at home and went to the second one today. The first one was great, really great (except I didn’t get the purpose of Mike’s story in Italy since they never mention it again ever), but the second one left me kinda disappointed? I always knew Part II was considered like one of the greatest movies of all time, but to me the biggest problem (that was also in part 1 but it wasn’t as bad) was the name dropping (for lack of a better term). They just kept saying names of people, only for them to show up on the screen without anything telling me “this is X guy who they were talking about before”. I’m ashamed to admit it took me until the hearing scene to realise Frankie and Pentangeli were the same person… \n\nThe name dropping combined with Mike looking for who tried to kill him gave birth to a sequence of scenes where they just talked about people that I didn’t know, and that I didn’t connect to the names when they showed up. It got so bad (and honestly just boring, since I wasn’t getting anything that was going on) that I fell asleep for 1-2minutes a few times and this only happens to me when I’m watching a BAD movie, like a REALLY BAD one.\n\nSince, as I said, it’s considered one of the staples of cinema, I’d like to try again (was thinking Friday), but I need to know is h to us some kind of common issue? Cuz at one point I started wondering if I’m just stupid. also, who was the one that ordered the killing of Mike? Was it left dubious on purpose? WHY did Frankie not talk when he saw his brother, did they explain this in any way? I have so many questions and it’s bothering me. Is there anything I can do to understand everything on my second watch, so that I can hopefully see what everyone else sees in this movie? Please, help me \n\nPutting the discussion flair cuz it seems appropriate I guess ",

(about Snape)>!Was Snape murdering Dumbledore justified?!<\n2. **Star Wars**. Did Darth Vader truly redeem himself?\n3. **Good Will Hunting**. Does Will have a moral obligation to use his genius?\n4. **Lord of the Rings**. (It's about the end)>!Was Frodo's failure a moral failure?!<\n5. **Robin Hood**. Can you steal from the rich to give to the poor?\n6. **Saving Private Ryan**. The morality of the mission (which itself is mentioned in the film).\n7. **The Matrix**. Blue pill v. red pill - is there a right choice between a difficult reality and a comfortable illusion?\n\nI've got others. Like superheroes and vigilante-ism. Or The Office and the morality of pranking other people.

        "selftext": "I'm probably not the only one to have thought about this. I still wanted to make a post though...\n\nSo My Old Ass stars Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza as the younger and older versions of the same person. The description reads: \"An 18th-birthday mushroom trip brings Elliott face-to-face with her wisecracking 39-year-old self\". So the younger and older versions have scenes together, the two actors are playing against each other all the time.\n\nSo already; what a legendary pairing this could have been for Jenna and Aubrey! There are plenty of memes on the internet about how they both kinda look alike and can play very similar characters. What caused the whole idea was most likely the similarly deadpan, creepy, but loveable characters of Aubrey's in Parks and Rec and Jenna's in Wednesday.\n\nAnd on top of that, the director, Megan Park's previous movie, The Fallout (2021) even starred Jenna Ortega. I genuenly wouldn't be surprised if Park had thought up the idea for this movie back then with Jenna and Aubrey in mind for these parts, but in the end Jenna couldn't make it for some reason. But maybe I'm totally wrong there. It's a pretty fun coincidence, still.\n\n(BTW with this post I'm not trying to say that the Maisy Stella - Aubrey Plaza duo is bad. On the contrary!)",

        "selftext": "I recently rewatched Carol for the first time in a year and I fell head over heels in love with again as I always do. The yearning, the gazes, the danger, and the unspoken words that the air seems to vibrate with make this the most romantic movie I have ever seen.\n\nI had a couple of topics I wanted to bring up to open up a dialogue on what a couple of the lines in the movie mean to you all. (WARNING: spoilers ahead - but if you still haven't seen the movie what are you doing?!)\n\nFirst, when Carol says \"what a strange girl you are. Flung out of space\" when they first meet over lunch and then again in the middle of the first time her and Therese make their relationship relationship - what do you think that means/what does that line mean to you?\n\nAdditionally, when Therese calls Carol on the phone and says \"I want to ask you things but I'm not sure you'd want that\" and Carol says \"ask me things, please.\" Why do you think she says that?\n\nFinally, the letter Carol writes Therese when she leaves her to head back to New York to attempt play by Harge's rules to get Rindy back after the tape of her sex with Therese is sent by the private investigator.\n\n*Dearest,*\n\n*There are no accidents, and he would have found us one way or another. Everything comes full circle. Be grateful it was sooner rather than later.*\n\n*You'll think it harsh of me to say so, but no explanation I offer will satisfy you. Please don't be angry when I tell you that you seek resolutions and explanations because you are young. But you will understand this one day. And when it happens, I want you to imagine me there to greet you. Our lives stretched out ahead of us, a perpetual sunrise.*\n\n*But until then, there must be no contact between us. I have much to do, and you, my darling, even more. Please believe that I would do anything to see you happy.*\n\n*So, I do the only thing I can.*\n\n*I release you.*\n\nWhat does that letter mean? \n\nI LOVE THIS MOVIE and I would love to hear your thoughts on it.",

        "selftext": "Millie Perkins as Anne Frank in \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" is a good example. George Stevens made an exceptional film, with some scenes so brilliant shot that they are unforgettable like the attic scene of Anne and Frank doing the laundry, but Millie Perkins as Anne is unbelievably bad. This isn't just a mediocre performance, this was a performance that is downright amauterish, literally no emotion in almost every line she says. She was Ali MacGraw bad. And it ruined the movie for me because I couldn't get over it. As superb as the supporting actors were, Shellley Winters even won an Oscar, Perkins made it impossible for the movie to rise above its flawed central casting. \n\n\"House of Gucci\" is not a great great movie but it would be taken seriously if Jared Leto didn't play his role like he was auditioning for Super Mario Bros. The worst part, the real person didn't act that way but Leto thought a Italian caricature would be showier.",

I didn't even mind Matthew Broderick or Leslie Mann being wasted in a girlfriend part. Broderick works as a straight man to Carrey's character, even if I didn't find Broderick charismatic enough to worth all that work from Carrey.\n\nIt's like you watch Bridget Fonda in Single White Female, you get it, but Broderick always came across as a middle-aged nerd in everything I've seen him in.",

In essence, Eve is self-destructive, always ruining her chances at happiness and remaining unfulfilled. Staying married to Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) is bad enough. \n\nMargo Channing (Bette Davis) started out as insecure and paranoid about getting old but by the end, she overcame that.

I know that some will say “oh it’s cuz you’ve been spoiled by modern horror” but I love old horror and actually dislike most modern because it’s too cliche and boring. But The Shining doesn’t really even feel like a horror movie to me. The book however was gripping, uncomfortable and very well worth the read. Can anyone else share their thoughts? ",

I enjoyed Bones & All more.\n\n>!&#x200B;!<Probably because the director manages to create this post-apocalyptic feeling based around the fact that these cannibals just avoid people as much as they can, their time is spent isolated, most of that isolation is spent in running away from connection, from society and Luca Guadaningo builds the movie’s theme around this loneliness. He creates beauty among the empty abandoned houses that eaters use, he creates style in them by clothing them with vibrant or more grounded colors, he makes us listen to them by giving them specific musical connections. Maren the main protagonist has this single guitar string that plays really loud in the silence whenever she gets closer to where she’s going. >!&#x200B;!<\n\nIt feels romantic to me because it also captures the scenic rurality of America so well. There are a lot of shots of just the skies as the two main characters drive across states, from Ohio to Kentucky to Missouri and Minnesota. The beautiful green fields, the forests, a small town here and there, s carnival it’s all there. I have never seen a more beautiful and aesthetically pleasing America as it is.\n\nBones & All is a moving coming-of-age tale about the innocence of age and shows the struggle with accepting who we are when nobody else does. Everything looks like a memory of an innocent age, in a contrast to “Challengers”, Bones & All has a softer aesthetic to it. There are no lavishly executed shots of one character in the frame to make them look like super models as in “Challengers”, everything just feels more natural.\n\nThe thesis of this movie as I see it is, do you deserve love and other good things even if you are so unwanted by society?\n\n7/10",

Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.\n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 11: Cyprus - Smuggling Hendrix\n\n>Day 10: Croatia - Kako je počeo rat na mome otoku (engl.: How the War Started on My Island)\n\n>Day 9: Bulgaria - Източни пиесиИзточни пиеси (engl.

In fact, that’s exactly what you want: third time around, the story of the little bear welcomed by strangers remains magical.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/paddington-in-peru-review-1236198939/):\n\n>“Paddington in Peru” is, as any Paddington adventure should be, fast and buoyant and disarmingly sunny in a way that viewers who weren’t alive -- or at least of cinemagoing age -- for the 2017 release of “Paddington 2” will lap up.\n\n[HeyUGuys](https://www.heyuguys.com/paddington-in-peru-review/) (5/5):\n\n>A wonderfully fun adventure with all the warmth, humour, and heart fans of this beloved franchise have come to adore. With just the right blend of humour and heartfelt moments, Paddington in Peru is a joyful adventure and a must-see for fans old and new!\n\n[Flick Feast](https://www.flickfeast.co.uk/reviews/film-reviews/paddington-peru/) (4/5):\n\n>Paddington in Peru promises wholesome fun and adventure - and the reassurance that there will be more to come from the marmalade-loving bear.\n\n[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3285085/paddington-peru-movie-review-third-times-still-charm-beloved-childrens-series) (4/5):\n\n>Given how often a threequel flops, Paddington in Peru effortlessly rises above its peers.\n\n[Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a62750565/paddington-3-review/) (4/5):\n\n>Paddington in Peru takes a bit of time to find its bearings but ends up delivering all the Paddington feels you hoped for.\n\n[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/family-movies/paddington-in-peru-review/) (4/5):\n>It's a welcome return for Paddington and the Brown family who in this installment journey to Peru to see his beloved Aunt Lucy. Antonio Banderas chews scenery with varying results but Olivia Colman is pitch-perfect as the all-singing all-dancing Reverend Mother. Paddington's latest adventure may be the weakest of the films so far but it remains a total delight.\n\n[Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14037919/Paddington-Peru-review-BRIAN-VINER.html) (4/5):\n\n>Grown-ups, however, might feel (as I did) that a little of the intrinsic charm and fun is lost by plucking Paddington away from London... On the other paw, it’s a pleasure to spend an hour and 43 minutes with Paddington in any setting.\n\n[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241103-paddington-in-peru-review-paddington-2) (4/5):\n>Paddington in Peru offers a fun and lively hour-and-three-quarters in the cinema, and that's not to be sniffed at, but it comes across as the solid third part of an established franchise rather than a stellar pop-cultural phenomenon in its own right.\n\n[The Times](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/paddington-in-peru-review-movie-olivia-colman-rgfn8zmht) (3/5):\n>Well, the bad news is that Paddington in Peru isn’t as good as Paddington 2. The good news is that Wilson has made an entertaining and endearing yarn that is worth 106 minutes of your time.\n\n[The Film Stage](https://thefilmstage.com/paddington-in-peru-review-threequel-fails-to-climb-to-franchise-heights/) (C+):\n\n>It’s clearly a disappointment compared to the two King-directed efforts, but is not without moments of comic inspiration, enjoyable supporting performances, and well-engineered adventure blockbuster set pieces.\n\n[Empire Magazine](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/paddington-in-peru/) (3/5):\n\n>The Paddington series goes 'Raiders of The Lost Bear', swapping Primrose Hill for the savage jungles of Peru. It's a decent threequel, though a little of the enchantment has been lost in transit.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/paddington-in-peru-movie-review-1235061942/) (C+):\n\n>There’s no denying that even Paul King’s table scraps taste better than most of what family audiences have been served over the last six years.\n\n[Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/paddington-in-peru-review-b2640826.html) (3/5)\n>Really, all you can do is take what joy you can from Paddington in Peru, because its pleasures are rarer but still sweet.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/04/paddington-in-peru-review) (3/5):\n>This Paddington threequel is a perfectly decent bet for the holidays, and never anything other than entertaining, but the gag density has thinned out and removing Paddington from Blighty... is a slightly shark-jumping move.\n\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/paddington-in-peru-review/) (3/5):\n\n>Let’s be fair: absolutely no one will have a bad time at Paddington in Peru, which is bouncy, unobjectionable and raises plenty of smiles. But most viewers are likely to come out more sated than elated.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/paddington-in-peru-review/):\n\n>The new film has some heart, but it’s buried beneath a lot of hackneyed writing and tedious padding. Like, a ton of padding. A padding ton.\n\n\n**Synopsis**:\n>PADDINGTON IN PERU brings Paddington’s story to Peru as he returns to visit his beloved Aunt Lucy, who now resides at the Home for Retired Bears.

        "selftext": "Which other Movies have a Tragic Story attached to Them or their Crew and what is it?\n\nI watched An Elephant Sitting Still the other day, a slow (you could say, contemplative) movie about a lot of things, most of them negative, such as pain, regret, disgust, alienation, apathy.\n\nI had heard about the hype for the film on the icheckmovies forum years ago, but the running time kept me from watching. I honestly thought it was directed by Gan Bi since he'd directed Kaili Blues which, to me, looked similar topically and visually at the time.\n\nSo anyway, turns out the director, Hu Bo, who's in my birth year, committed suicide shortly after completing the film. I would assume that parts of this movie were autobiographical and a mix of the emotions that he felt, and likely a regret that haunted his adult life.\n\nI'm wondering if there are any other films out there that you've come across with such a tragic circumstance. They don't have to be linked to the director, it could be a screenwriter or someone else integral to the film.\n\nI'm sure most are aware of Brandon Lee's death on set, so perhaps something not so obvious, but hey, whatever, do as you will.\n\nDo note that An Elephant Sitting Still is not for everyone and it is 4 hours long. I would recommend trying out the aforementioned Kaili Blues or Black Coal, Thin Ice or The Wild Goose Lake and then Eureka (2000) or maybe something more fun like Blue Spring or All About Lily Chou-Chou to get you in the mood.\n\n",

        "title": "Rewatched 'Adaptation (2002) and it is not about screenwriting.",
        "selftext": "I had watched Adaptation quite a few years back and I remember seeing florida, crocodiles and some guy hopelessly trying to write something about mundane. It was a fun watch, but I didn't know why.\n\nNow, years later, I watched an instagram reel which showcases the monologue of Mckee to Charlie Kaufmann about life being the most interesting thing ever and if he (Charlie) think that it is just mundane things and no big revelations he should not write a movie(I will put a youtube link below if anyone'sinterested or forgot about the scene). That scene haunted me, I dont remember that scene the movie, what else was I missing, what was the movie really about? \n\nThen, I rewatched the movie and boy, I think I understand now what the movie really was about. The title Adaptation on the superficial sense points to Charlie's attempts to adapt the book into a movie, but on a deeper level it is the adaptation to life itself. Of how we change into something we were not, and how passions drive us to it.\n\nIn the beginning, Charlie is a firm believer of life is boring with mundane shits repeating day after day and the movies and books are all glorification of life which has no truth in it. We see later, the author of the book about orchid (Susan Orlean) has similar views about life until she meets Laroch (the guy with no front tooth). But soon enough, she admires and even be jealous of the passion of Laroch to the things he is currently doing, whether be it fishing, planting or even hunting orchids. He is not ashamed of his passions even if they are illegal or immoral in other people's eyes. This is something Susan have hard time to wrap her head around. Even though she is a very successful journalist, she is not passionate about anything, she can't be who she really is without being ashamed of herself. This shame about oneself and admiration to the other, she latches onto Laroch as a leech and follows him in his journey.\n\nCharlie is in a similar state of mind. He is ashamed of the persona he projects into the world, his blockbusters are what he himslef would call lifeless and untrue, and he wants to be honest for once. To be honest, is to be courageous, and he lacks courage to what needs to be done. He lacks the passion to the world. He hates life. When he reads The book Susan wrote, he is captivated by something in it. He cannot pinpoint it, and he misinterprets the book as a mundane book about flowers and thats what makes it great. He wants to make a movie about flowers being great, but he himself doesn't believe it. So what exactly is he seeking? What is hooking him to this book?\n\nWe see Laroch is a pretty smart guy who is really good at what he's doing. But his passions have changed a lot in the years and he never looked back. He is not doing anything for fame or money, but to the thrill of doing something he really cares about. What Susan, and Charlie through her seeking is, how to be passionate about something without being ashamed of the passion. That is what draws Susan to Leroch, Charlie to the book, and us the audience to the movie without us being aware of it.\n\nOrchids are fascinating. Each species has a specific morphology which resembles a specific animal and they make love to each other. And when the bee makes love to two of these orchids, they get pollinated. The orchid or the bee does not have the ability to comprehend their actions on a grander scale. Whay they do is just following their passion and the that keeps the world going, without them knowing it. We are all orchids. And bees. Whatever we do, we dont know its significance. We are not passionate about anything because we will(will as in Will) it, but because we have no choice. We are destined to live however the way we live. And the world will rotate.\n\nWe do not make the change, we are changed when it is time to. It is not a willful choice, but an inevitability. The movie says, not to worry about being unable to change, being unable to chase your passions or being unable to be honest or courageous. Whatever you chase, even if you know it consciously or not, will be the road you'll be taking. You are seeking your orchids always.\n\nI know this write up came up as mumbo jumbo in the screen. It was clear in mind though. I have not done justice to the movie. If you haven't watched the movie or if you forgot what the movie was about, do give it another shot. Its a fantastic one.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JHVqxD8PNq8\n\nYoutube link.",

Then I also kinda felt the salvation story angle, the 2 comic novels were also interesting to follow it. For sure don't think it is as bad as so manyade it to be. I felt the dark fate timeline is terrible and ruins everything that the franchise stood for.\n\n\n\n2) the DC darkseid timeline. I liked man of steel and the directors cut of justice league. Sure all the DC hero movies were not as good but I was invested in that timeline and ready to see the fight against the big bad. Do feel bad we will never see it and they are rebooting it but I respected the serious and darker tone that DC set, it did not need to be light hearted bright and funny with punchlines like marvel were trying.",

It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's competently produced with an interesting premise, and I was enjoying it throughly. >!But then the ending comes along. What the hell was that?! This is one of, if not THE laziest movie endings I have ever seen. If Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Jonathan Abrams had picked *literally any other* potential ending and just committed to it, it would have been a better choice. This faux ambiguous ending bullshit is just creatively bankrupt cowardice, the product of moviemakers who don't know how to finish their story and don't want to be bothered to try so they pass that work onto the audience and pretend it's an actual decision rather than the lack of any decision at all. The movie is already full of interesting moral questions, no matter how it ended people would have been talking about whether the right choices were made and whether justice was truly served. Now all I can think about is how mad I am that Eastwood had the gall to dump this half finished mess into the theaters and call it a day.!<\n\n>!When the movie ended several people in my theater were audibly disappointed, saying things like \"WTF was that?!\" or \"No! Don't end it that way!\" so I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'd be interested to hear from anyone else who has seen the movie. It's a shame because the rest of the movie was quite decent but the ending annoyed me so much I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I do not endorse cowardice in the arts.!<\n\nNote: I would have put this in the official discussion thread for Juror No. 2, but I actually can't find one, perhaps because the movie just came out.",

The students end up dying in Afghanistan or a country like it, the scene we’re they die is epic, they are either out of ammo or injured and about to get captured. As the enemy approaches them they decide to go out together and raise their weapons to the enemy and the get the absolute shit shot out of them and they die.\n\nIt’s been many years since I’ve seen this movie and no matter how many different google searches I do I can’t come up with anything.

When he got send down after 333, his first “Roommate” (which i relate to God in the first testament) Trimagasi says “it is time to get off my snail” to which Goreng replies “not yet” to which Trimagasi says “but you are not the message. She is.” And then i relate him getting off on the last stop as kind of a crucifixion in the end. The WHOLE movie has a huge religious vibe to it now and it tripped me out bad. Ik i sound delusional but i know you’ll get it too if u watch. Not trying to convert anyone i just thought this movie a second time was an emotional rollercoaster. Ty for reading this far 💗",

The initially benevolent artificial intelligence turns evil and the last act is man vs cold unfeeling machine? boring, cliche, played out. \n\nI just saw Duncan Jones' movie Moon, and I fully expected the AI in it to do what so many lesser sci-fi movies do and go full HAL 9000 on Sam Rockwell - and considering the AI was voiced by Kevin fucking Spacey I wouldn't have been surprised. But the movie's robot companion remains a faithful and loyal servant throughout, and even ends up saving the protagonist in the end. It's very touching and I think means something, because in the end none of the human characters really cared for Sam - his bosses don't care about him because he's a disposable clone, his wife isn't even really his wife, even his original self sold out to the company and allowed his clones to be worked and killed off. In the end, it is a cold, unfeeling machine that is his only aide. \n\nFor a movie that is about man's ability to use technology to serve himself regardless of the moral implications, it's interesting that the robot acts the most \"human\".",

        "selftext": "What do you think his best role is? I think it’s gotta be American History X, but it’s very close between that and Primal Fear. He was just perfect for that role in AHX. I think he and Edward Furlong, which by the way is a huge shame what happened to him. But the whole time watching AHX I was amazed at Nortons ability to pull off that character which was a very hard role to be good in for any actor in my opinion, for obvious reasons lol. After that he became lead man in many great critically acclaimed films in which a few have been considered classics. \n\nNorton has been nominated for Oscar’s for AHX as best actor, and Birdman and Primal Fear for best supporting actor. I believe he should have won for AHX and also Primal Fear, but unfortunately the iconic film came out the same year so Roberto Benigni won in 1999. In 1997 Cuba Gooding won best supporting and 2014 JK Simmons won for Whiplash, very deservingly. \n\nSome other notable films Norton has been in other than American History X and Primal Fear and Birdman are F**** C*** (😂), 25th hour, The Score, Kingdom of Heaven, Red Dragon, Rounders, The People vs Larry Flynt, The Italian Job, The Illusionist, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel. Absolutely unreal filmography, not as good as Leo or Brad Pitt or some others but way better than your average actor. What is your favorite Norton performance?",

It just felt like he was naturally a dumb ass.I think a hyperrealistic ending would have been great since everything else before that fell flat.If he had killed her while she begged to live. It would have been a cold ending but a memorable one and tied well into the beginning.\n\nBut no she's somehow a ninja who secretly steals a knife while not only tied up but injected with a paralytic.That being said ,he specifically says that even if she gains movement she won't have enough motor skills yet someone has the motor skills to sneakily steal a knife and then precisely stab him with enough force.Then also swim back to shore to stand victoriously over his body.\n\n It feels like they were desperate to make another girly boss movie but as a girl I think the movie was ASS.\n\nIt does not hit the same as something like Gone girl or I spit on your grave.\n\n",

Challengers for me, feels a little too long, a bit too over indulgent, and sometimes out of place and time but somehow the movie manages to make you feel like it’s 2h 15m runtime is justified. It starts at present and then jumps back to the past and then present, sort of going back-and-forth but everytime the distance becomes reduced until it reaches the final scene.\n\nBy that point, you know every motivation, every glance, every movement of the camera and it all speaks so much about the characters and how they feel in that moment.\n\nThis is also a lot more about tennis then i imagined. Just amazes me to see these actors being so comfortable and awesome with a racket in their hands, serving and playing tennis often in one-shot sequences where everything could have gone wrong.\n\nRating: N/A (might rewatch)",

Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.\n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

How is the viewer SUPPOSED to feel about MC getting assaulted like thrice. \n- the ending..? Like what even happens here was Mary Sue with 5 lines of dialogue lovergirl all along or did lovergirl's spirit posess Mary Sue with 5 lines of dialogue's body. \n- unlikable characters again because how do you direct a whole movie and fail to give anyone a single redeeming quality\n. \nThe ONE (singular) praise I do have is pretty scenery. \n. \nGo on Reddit tell me why I'm wrong.

        "selftext": "The most convincing knife scenes are of someone spreading butter. But in scenes of violence, even in the gritty movies, a knife is used to slash or used for a single deadly stab.\n\nIRL instances of violence with a knife we see reports of people getting stabbed dozens of times. Which makes sense because unless there's surgical precision and a dummy for a victim, odds are someone will get stabbed where they can live to struggle, even if for 5 minutes before bleeding out.\n\nIn knife fight scenes the attacker never rushes for 30 stabs. Even the killer in a slasher movie, the closest to a convincing use of a knife, the psycho killer will slowly stab his victim a couple of times. In thrillers someone pulls a knife against the bad guy, then they just slash never go for a stab. If they did, of course, a single stab would kill the bad guy. If it's a stab in the back, he screams and dies. Twice unconvincing according to those in the know.\n\nSo TL;DR rant over.\n\nHave you ever seen any a convincingly realistic knife fight scene? Or any realistic knife attack scenes?\n\nI suppose a proper realistic scene would make anyone squirm.",

I decided to make notes of some movies that I felt would pique my interest from several different Reddit posts, and there were a few this year that really gripped me\n\nIn no particular order the ones that you all helped me with that I thought were great:\n\nLate Night with the Devil\nBarbarian\nHell House LLC\nHouse of the Devil\n1408\n\nMy girlfriend doesn’t like scary movies (which is a shame, and probably why I haven’t watched as many lately), so we have an agreement that I get to make her watch 1 every Halloween.  I got her off to a rough start a few years ago with Hereditary, then let her off easy the next year with Gremlins (a childhood movie which she admittedly was scared of), then this year I built her up with 1408.  I think Barbarian would be a good step up again for her next year unless my newfound appreciation of the thrill let’s me choose another one that would fit the time and the place\n\nIf anyone else has any good recommendations based off the above I would greatly appreciate it.  Some of the my favorites that I’ve seen not mentioned above, but which may also include some mind-fuck movies Ives enjoyed:\n\nRec\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\nThe Decent\nJoker (1st one with J. Phoenix I consider that a horror)\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\nAlien Movies / Prometheus (I thought Alien: Romulus was great!  The scene with the alien blood made me feel like I was playing Dead Space with the anti gravity all over again)",

I’d love to hear your thoughts:\n\n\t1.\tWho is Roger talking to on the phone?\n\t•\tRoger says things like “Can’t do a thing for you. Your mess. You clean it up. Don’t be callin’ me.” He acts like it’s no big deal, even though the caller sounds stressed. Do you think Roger’s brushing it off to avoid drawing attention? Or could he actually be talking to Alonzo in a way that mirrors Alonzo’s own mess?\n\n\t2.\tDoes Roger’s ability to identify Hoyt change anything?\n\t•\tWhen Roger says, “You play strong safety for North Hollywood High?” it seems to make Alonzo tense up a bit. Do you think the fact that Roger recognizes Hoyt as a player from North Hollywood affects how Alonzo sees him? Like, does knowing this make Hoyt more of a potential liability in Alonzo’s eyes?\n\n\t3.\tWhat’s up with that snail joke?\n\t•\tRoger says, “Figure that joke out and you’ll figure the streets out.” Do you think there’s any merit to that? Is there some kind of meaning to the joke that’s meant to reflect the life they’re living, or is he just messing with Hoyt?\n\n\t4.\tWhy does Alonzo even stop by Roger’s the first time?\n\t•\tThere’s got to be a reason beyond just visiting an old friend. Alonzo seems like he always has a purpose. What’s his real agenda here?\n\n\t5.\tIs Roger a former cop or just a well-connected drug dealer?\n\t•\tRoger knows a lot about Alonzo’s early days and mentions things like, “You were just like him,” when he talks to Alonzo about Hoyt. Do you think he could be ex-law enforcement, or is he just that deep into the street world?\n\nThis is actually my first ever Reddit post, so if these questions have already been discussed before, I’d really appreciate being pointed toward those posts as well!",

Then when it's clear Peter and Francine need to go, they're just waiting around at the ladder and Peter for some reason wants to sacrifice himself, when they've both got more than enough time to go. Eventually, Francine goes up to the helicopter and Peter just retrieves into his room. He locks himself inside and is clearly about to blow his brains out.\n\nThen when the zombies do get in, he has a change of heart and has to desperately fight his way through. He then runs up to the helicopter, while fighting them off and getting his gun grabbed off him by one of them, making a narrow escape.  \n\nOnce they're flying away, she admits they don't have very much fuel. \n\nIt just seems like such a baffling way they've all behaved. Surely, they should of all just escaped straight away on the helicopter and been more prepared. Throughout the film, it just felt like the characters were getting more and more complacent.

The two recent leads (Ortega and Barrera) having distanced themselves, as well as on/off again casting issues with Neve Campbell.  Plus, most of the fan favorite cast members have died and/or aren't a great fit for a new Ghostface.\n\nIMO the best thing Scream could do would be to take a page from Craven's New Nightmare, and have the next film take place in the \"real\" world - with Ghostface hunting down actors from all of the previous films (playing themselves). Cox, Arquette, Kennedy, Lillard, Gellar, etc.  It would be a perfect sendoff to such a meta franchise and one last hurrah with all the fan favorites, plus it would allow for an actual, real whodunnit scenario.\n\nWho would you want to be the killer if they went this direction? What would their motive be?",

I rewatched all the Purge movies for Halloween this year, and I find her character to be so contrived and annoying. I looked to see if anyone else had made a post about it like everyone did for the kid in the first movie but no one did so here I am. \n\nThroughout the entire movie Cali asks the questions that the audience is thinking, but that we really don't need answers to because they will be answered later in the movie.\n\nHer character somehow thinks that she's more important than she is. Like when she asked the vigilante who saved them \"why us?\", I remember yelling at the screen saying \"Because he saw you\" and at the same time he said \"because I saw you\". Like, Cali, it's not any deeper than that!!! \n\nThen she begs the vigilante that saves them to stay with them despite him having somewhere to go as if it's his responsibility to take care of them just because he got them out of one situation. \n\nThen towards the end of the movie, she's trying to convince the vigilante character that he shouldn't go do what he's about to do like they didn't just meet eight hours ago and she has any authority over his life or decisions at all. \n\nAnd when they're in the back of the van with the gang members who were collectinv stragglers to take to rich people for sport, she asked again \"what do you want from us?\" Even the Mom got annoyed at this point. \n\nI don't understand where she got this sense of personalized grandiosity. Maybe and obviously it's because she is one of the main characters in the movie, but the way they wrote her is absolutely the worst. \n\n",

Just the revving audio as loud as possible without hurting our ears. I'd call it an eargasm that is on par with any of my all time favorite songs. We'll also watch the rest of the intro because the sound is so good and the scene is so intense.\n2. The first minute of Dune: The immediate foreign language echoing throughout the room and the drums for the Legendary logo. I'll also show them the procession of nobles from the ship onto Dune. People who aren't used to subwoofers love the bass from the drums rumbling the couch. And then the scene where the first sandworm erupts and engulfs the spice scavenger. The chords and bass notes are incredibly exhilarating after seeing the eye candy of the sand and worm.\n3. There's a fight scene in Man of Steel about 1:30 in where he fights two of zod's best by himself. The fight feels so heavy and real that it makes the kryptonians seem that much more epic. The sound has aged fairly well.\n4. Literally the classic Universal intro with the earth spinning.\n5. Godzilla Minus One when Godzilla first shows up and is chasing the small boat. Boom.\n\nDo you guys have any other stunning moments in movies you like to share with guests that is specifically better because of the audio? Notice that these aren't about the acting or full scenes per se, but how the audio takes everything to an entirely different level.",

        "selftext": "As the title says. The wife and I watched a bunch of newer horror movies for spooky season, and we noticed the devil was a real force in many of them, including Longlegs and Late Night With The Devil.\n\nLonglegs and Late Night With The Devil just ended up being ok to me. Both started out amazing. The leads were great, the premises were great, and the first 30 or so minutes had me hooked. But as both revealed the stories and introduced the devil as kind’ve this overbearing force in the movie, I just couldn’t get into them. \n\nThe Witch’s (Robert Eggers) portrayal of Satan, embodying Black Phillip but not revealing himself until the damage had already been done by the families own sins (the father’s pride, the mother’s envy, Caleb’s lust, etc) and the actual witch in the movie, is still my all time favorite. Thomason agrees to sell her soul and join the witches at the end because she lost everything due to her family’s innate human weakness and their acquiescence to their sinful nature. But..it’s only when she has nothing left that the Devil appears, offering “respite”. \n\nI’m not religious in the least, but I went to church until I was around 10-11, so pretty formative years. My church was heavy on fearing The Devil as a real force/entity. But not like these other two movies portrayed him, where the Devil is literally a force inside these dolls that hypnotize you into killing your family (really, Longlegs?) or a demon embodying a young girl and doing typical Exorcist shit (Late Night). \n\nMy church’s message was more about constantly being aware of more subtle influences. That feeling of wanting to “sin” because there’s some sense of selfish pleasure you’re seeking? *That’s* the devil’s influence. Letting drugs fuck your life up physically isn’t the devils work…he completed his job when you were propositioned and instead of saying no like you were taught to, like you know is “right” to…that “what’s the worst that could happen? It’ll probably be fun!” is Satan whispering from your shoulder. He’s fucking with your human weaknesses (as they saw, obviously this shit is insane lol). He’s not this force of evil that’s going to force your hand; he’s going to guide you to going through what you were already wanting to do. Your own earthly sins, your own human flaws are going to drive you into what he wants, not him forcing you or taking your body over like a demon. Your own destruction is within you, and these things that you’re told are wrong that feel pleasurable? Yeah, they’re designed to destroy you. \n\nWhich is why when, in The Witch, when he is whispering in that calming, ethereal voice “Wouldst thou like the taste of butter? Wouldst thou like to wear a pretty dress? Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?”, it gave me goosebumps the first time I watched the movie. I dunno that I ever feared the devil when I was little, I never really bought into religion, but if I did, this is kindve how I would’ve believed he could be. Not terrifying…but intoxicating. Not forcing me to sin and corrupt my stupid mortal soul, but subtly encouraging me to do what I already wanted to do. One final push.\n\nThat’s why I love when Thomason says she can’t sign her name over to him, he says “I will guide thy hand.” \n\nJust brilliant! ",

But it has played on my since. \n\nI have watched it several times since and I find a lot of meaning in this film, and here is my take: this film can be applied to the repetitive nature of our own existence, the challenges we face, and the apparent meaninglessness of our lives. There are three separate ways of dealing with it.\n\nNyles: \n\nHis character represents absolute nihilism (is it really a coincidence that he is called Nyles?). I was initially struck by how visually similar his charter is to Peter Stormare in The Big Lebowski; two nihilists adrift from reality, floating in a pool with a beer in hand.  \nFor Nyles, the loop is something to surrender to. Life is meaningless, so why not submit to an endless routine of hedonism with no consequence?  Nyles represents the idea of opting out from society. The fuck it approach. He embraces apathy and self indulgence.  \nI am quite sure I have spent a lot of my time in life like Nyles.\n\nSarah:\n\nSarah represents something of an existential awakening and the desire for growth and accountability. She is not like Nyles and she strongly opposes the loop. She fights it with all she has. She wishes to understand and take ownership of her mistakes. She seeks meaning and redemption through personal responsibility, and she tries to change things. She wants to break free from the past, and the cycle of guilt and self loathing that she has suffered and realises that courage and self-confrontation are required. I have also spent time in my life acting like Sarah.\n\nRoy:\n\nRoy is perhaps the most interesting, He starts off bitter, vengeful, and angry, but unlike the other two, he finds peace in the loop. He doesn't fight, like Sarah and he doesn't give up, like Nyles. Instead Roy represents a philosophy I have always admired: stoicism. He find acceptance. He embraces the beauty of small moments with his family. Roy teaches us that a meaningful existence can be found by appreciating being in the present, and neither fighting not capitulating to the madness we are bound to. I have never quite managed to live life like Roy, but I aspire to it.",

        "title": "Argument: Tom Cruise is a method actor ",
        "selftext": "**Not clickbait. And no, I won't take a side on whether or not he is a good dramatic actor, not here. I am here to argue that in doing what he does as a stunt performer, he has elevated himself to the level of a method actor. This argument hinges on a distinction between two levels of method acting.**\n\n**So, my argument is that what most people think of as method acting (MA) has at least two levels to it. And my opinion here is that Tom Cruise embraces one of these, but not the other. But before I do this, I want you to consider an analogy.**\n\n**Consider a world without the word “instrumental artist”. A world where to be a musical artist involved either just singing, or both singing and playing an instrument. Songs with just singing and no instruments were normal, and so were songs with both instruments and singing. Now, in this world, you can imagine all the semantic pedantic debates about whether (what we call “instrumental artists”) are truly artists? I argue that Tom Cruise is a method actor in one of two levels, in the same way that Mozart is an artist in one of two levels.**\n\n**So, there are two levels of method acting. Some do either, some do both. Both are method acting. The two levels of MA are the dramatic and the technical. In the same sense that the two levels of music are singing and playing instruments. What Heath Ledger did as Joker was mostly dramatic MA, since he had to alter his personality to play this character. However, there was little technical MA; he didn’t have to learn any skills or techniques, beyond what you see in normal acting. Heath Ledger is like a singer who doesn’t play an instrument. What Tom Cruise is doing in Mission Impossible etc. is technical method acting, he’s drilling his stunts down to his very own art. He goes beyond any regular stunt performer in doing so, especially when you consider 1) the immense scale of his stunts (driving a motorcycle off a cliff and skydiving down the mountain), and 2) the insane amount of training that goes into that (500 skydives, 13.000 motor cross jumps, in this example). This is not just a regular stunt performance; it is a highly elevated form of stunt performing. By analogy, Tom is like an instrumental artist who doesn’t sing. Finally, we have DDL, who often embraces both levels. He does dramatic MA in the form of becoming narcissists, athletes, mob leaders etc. but also technical MA in the form of tailoring, slaughtering, boxing, etc. By analogy, DDL is like an artist who both sings and plays instruments.**\n\n**So, in the same way we can say that Heath Ledger’s Joker was methodical in the dramatic but not the technical sense, we can say that Tom Cruise is doing the opposite. Joker is method acting because it goes way beyond what you expect from regular acting, in terms of scale and dedication. And we all know the emotional lengths Heath went to play this character. Conversely, in dedicating his whole life to just drilling down stunts on the motorcycle, jet plane, helicopter, etc. and doing so in a way that goes way beyond most method actors: Tom Cruise is very much a technical method actor.**\n\n**Someone may point out that while Ledger and DDL are performing off-camera, Cruise is not. Some may also argue that Cruise is just doing what other stunt performers also do. Or that what he is doing is not the same as becoming a character through ordinary method acting. These claims are demonstrably false. The training for MI7 involved 2 WHOLE YEARS of Tom Cruise doing absolutely nothing else but just constantly training things like motocross, skydiving, and a niece extreme sport called a speed flying (extremely deadly btw). So, he is immersing himself into these stunts behind the screen, and to a scale and with a dedication that few other stunt performers can match. In doing these skydives and motocross jumps, he is gradually becoming the Ethan Hunt we see in Dead Reckoning. The dramatic focus, vigor, calm and competence we see from Ethan Hunt in the movie, was developed through Cruise performing the stunts that generate such emotions in the first place.**\n\n**He's not just crashing cars or jumping down stairs. And he's not just doing the stunts that are on his payroll. And in the same way that DDL's acting made it actionable for the director to elevate most of his films to a level that was otherwise impossible with regular actors; McQuarrie is allowed to do exactly that through the methods of Cruise.**\n\n**Something else to point out, is that Cruise is not some type of athlete who practices stunts for a separate sport, and gets hired to do these types of film jobs occasionally. He was not a jet pilot before Top Gun, and he was not a helicopter pilot before Fallout. All these films involved Cruise BECOMING Ethan Hunt/ Maverick, over the course of months or years. So, he's not just an ordinary physical/ stunt performer. He is training and performing, exclusively to perform these roles, and to a completely unparalleled level.**\n\n**Folks, say whatever you want about his apparent/ alleged personality disorder, religious extremism, horrendous family life, etc. Tom Cruise is a method actor in the technical sense. I am a massive fan of DDL, but there is no debating that what Tom is doing goes leagues ahead of DDL sitting in a wheelchair, tailoring or sparring. Tom Cruise may not be the most impressive dramatic actor, let alone a dramatic MA (like DDL). He may never be. However, I argue that he is a one-of-a-kind sole-technical method actor.**\n\n**Prove me wrong**\n\n  \n**Edit: I apologize for the spelling errors in the first version. Feel free to point out other grammatical or syntactic errors. English is not my first language.**",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Solid performances by the cast pull us into another futuristic story of AI going wrong. Familiar themes done in a believable and entertaining way.\n\nThe Good: \n1. The cast: It’s easy to sympathize with the family. Michele Morrone, Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth have great chemistry, and Jude Greenstein rounds out the family as the ridiculously adorable baby. Megan Fox is perfect as the AI Alice. She plays into the “bad/robotic” acting criticism she’s previously received by literally playing a robot under synthetic human skin. And she completely pulls it off.\n2. The story: The family keeps us invested. It’s easy to root for them the entire movie. The themes of being a good parent/spouse, challenges of raising children, fear of being replaced, power dynamics, infidelity, and dealing with sickness and external threats to family members were all done well.\n3. The effects: While it’s no major blockbuster in terms of effects, what they did use was effective. There weren’t any moments of noticeably bad CGI that can often pull people out of a movie.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. This movie surprised me with how entertaining it was. I enjoyed it so much that I may not have noticed little things that may have bothered others.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1. The realization of how common sex with robots would become. Especially in the scenario where they look and act like humans.\n",

There is no \"my green eyes flashed as I decided how to rebel against the system and choose which of my two friends I was in love with\".\n\nIt doesn't get much chatter, and I doubt Ford considered it much beyond the paycheck but he really stood out to me in the film.\n\nGraff is a character who has completely accepted that the ends justify the means. In a war where the loser goes extinct, it doesn't matter how you achieve victory. If you win, then you can have your accountability and justice afterwards, but if you lose, nothing will matter. I was totally convinced that Ford's character saw the children as nothing but tools, to be tested to destruction if necessary. He berates, he manipulates, everything is about the mission. The only time he lets a crack show is the shouting match he and the protagonist have after victory is achieved.\n\nThe character also suits Harrison Ford's strengths. He's ornery and stand-offish and he snaps at people. He's not required to do physical work, simply fill the room with an intimidating presence just by standing still.",

Imagine this: all the VIPs and politicians are there… and when chaos breaks out, the guards don’t even have guns? Okay, let’s say guns aren’t allowed. But why did it take so long for the police to arrive? Or why wasn’t there any police presence at all when Rana Singh was there? The scenes were just so illogical by that point.\n\nThen, imagine this again: Chaos is happening, and Rana decides to go up the elevator? Wouldn’t you try to leave the building? Okay, maybe going up is safer for a quick helicopter escape. But why did it take so long for them to get on the helicopter? And the ending was terrible—why was Baba Shakti just waiting in the VVIP room? It was so laughable. What a waste of a movie. It was good but ruined at the end.",

        "title": "My Go-to Sci-Fi, Horror, Giallo Double Feature List",
        "selftext": "I love curating a double feature, so much that I still think fondly of the many viewing parties I did in my old apartment of 1975's *Grey Gardens* with the 2009 TV Movie, pairing the real with the fiction.\n\nTo a gamut of genres and sub-genres, when I just need four hours of film with stylistic, visual or thematic consistency, these are my go-to double features that nobody asked for (keep in mind, the order below is the order I would watch them):\n\n* *Passion* (2012, Brian De Palma) and *Neon Demon (*2016, Nicolas Winding Refn): the category is a psychological horror with lesbian revenge undertones all packaged in a muted yet saturated (IYKYK) visual style that the two both do well. They also package the misogyny and jealousy of hating another woman with the attraction of hating a woman, obviously with very different plots and one with a more fantastical plot than the other, but the same grapevine, in my opinion.\n* *Who Saw Her Die* (1972, Aldo Lado and Vittorio De Sisti) and *Don't Look Now (*1973, Nicolas Roeg): the latter is very much inspired by the former, both set in Venice, I like seeing these as \"horror tourism\" since they do capture Venice, Italy quite nicely as a place to go; and beauty of Venice in the 70s. The theme of murder and abduction is similar, but the difference between the Italian and American remakes with Donald Sutherland is a neat cultural comparison.\n* *Unbreakable* (2000, M. Night Shyamalan) and *Malignant (*2021, James Wan): both have twists, and both include the concept of the weak versus able-bodied. Both view supernatural abilities through this lens of medical conditions or \"disorder.\"\n* *I Know Who Killed Me* (2007, Chris Sivertson) and *Death Walks at Midnight* (1972, Luciano Ercoli): a modern Giallo versus traditional Giallo style that is more similar than you think: my crash course double feature to Giallo newbies without being super on the nose with an Argento choice. First, for millennials, choosing a Giallo-style film with Lindsay Lohan gets people raising an eye. Then, with *Death Walks*, you can note the similar themes between the two movies: a memorable murder weapon, supernatural undertones for both films and the big thing that I think people always forget what makes Giallo a Giallo is that there needs to be an ongoing police investigation and police presence, which both movies have.\n* *The Island* (2005, Michael Bay) and *Total Recall* (2012, Len Wiseman): my go-to science fiction, attractive leads, blockbuster, medical science genre of action flicks that I think pair well together. When you just want to watch pretty people move, and some stuff blows up, they both deal with \"light themes\" of medical advancement consistent with a future dystopia.\n* *Lucy* (2014, Luc Besson) and *Limitless* (2011, Neil Burger) are movies in which the drug enhances the abilities of the protagonists but also kills them. In my opinion, the male protagonist version and the female protagonist version are the yin and yang of this particular genre of designer drugs-creating superheroes.\n\nThat's it for now; I have more, but I am happy to hear other people's recommendations; also, any academic insight like I did would be cool. But I'm a nerd, and I sometimes enjoy the motive of a double feature more than the actual viewing.",

        "title": "The Substance is a masterclass in Psychological Horror. ",
        "selftext": "First of all, I believe that Demi Moore deserves major Kudos for taking on a role that directly confronts the ideals of her own industry. Imperfections aside, this movie crafts an allegory of aging that feels disturbingly resonant, reminding us of the value of embracing mortality and the dignity of aging gracefully. Moore really put on an arresting performance embodying the journey from an attractive rising star to an aging icon whose name is etched on Hollywood boulevard but who now fades into the background, overlooked and forgotten. \n\nI cannot help but see haunting parallels with society’s obsession with plastic surgeries, BBLs, Liposuctions and the relentless pursuit of perfection. The way this addiction is portrayed feels grounded in reality, it mirrors the way we become trapped, wanting more and more, reshaping ourselves until we lose touch of our own identity.\n\n The finale of this movie is quite shocking and purposefully grotesque, a horror that captures the inevitable consequence of rejecting natural aging, I believe this was the director’s way of showing the horror that comes from refusing to accept natural aging, it’s as if the very essence of this pursuit morphs into a monster, a distorted version of humanity driven by an insatiable hunger for youth. It is what happens when society pushes the pursuit of beauty to the extreme, feeding an addiction that ultimately consumes the person entirely. \n\nDennis Quad’s performance brought a sort of intensity here that was quite raw and very unsettling (the shrimp scene will stay with me for a while), a character that is basically caught in his moral decay. His character resembles the darker side of ambition, where success and status take precedence over humanity. He is basically the representation of the dark underbelly of Hollywood. A person that has no loyalty, no support and no care for what happens when people are valued only for their looks which in turn creates a desperation to remain relevant. \n\nThe moral of the story here is simple, our fixation on outward beauty can turn us into monsters. This movie wasn’t just horror for the sake of horror but uses the genre to make a powerful statement about the obsession with youth and lengths people go to defy aging. It left me with a deeply thought provoking experience, an unforgettable reminder on cultural addiction that leaves us questioning our own views on age and beauty. An experience I will revisit again.

His character deserved it, given how he kept going further and further off the deep end, all for the sake of the grift, to the point where he killed two people. I should've seen it coming; the fact that he went from a wealthy mentalist to the type of person that was pitied and looked down upon the most. That was a real gut punch, especially considering how that geek was treated in the beginning, which Stan witnessed up close. It brought it all full-circle.\n\nThat said, this movie was good but not great. The second act was too bloated, and could've been at least 15 minutes shorter. There should've been less scenes with Cate Blanchett's character, as Stan's relationship with her just wasn't very deep or interesting. Plus it essentially led to nothing given how she betrays him in the end. It should've focused more on Rooney Mara's character and their relationship. Not to mention the judge's wife's murder-suicide?!? WTF? So random.\n\nIn the end, I still recommend this movie, despite it's 2.5-hour runtime.

Some revel in their ideas of leader worship and ruthless violence. But on the same hand, there's no comprehension in movies of democratic propaganda. Or democratic terrorism. These things simply \"do not compute\". So there is the irony.\n\nI only want to know of movies that specifically, directly and earnestly critique democracy from its own democracy from the top down. No Hunter Johnson no Bukowski no fingering around like Natural Born Killers. I want movies that intelligently critique modern democracy.",

There's a lot of droopy baggage in his filmography.  Plus, he's arguably the generation after Kubrick, before this one.\n\nArguably, Christopher Nolan in terms of scope of vision and genre. He's known for a mix of science fiction and historical epics. Like, Kubrick. Although, their tone is very different. Nolan is less acerbic. \n\nIn terms of having a dark comical slant. You could point to this year The Substance by Coralie Fargeat. It will be interesting to see what she does next. I can imagine she will have a lot of freedom to do something just as bonkers and disturbing. Or, maybe she will surprise us and do something different like Kubrick.\n \nWho do you think could be in contention for this generation's Stanley Kubrick?",

        "title": "The Garbage Pail Kids Movie shows the normal humans were right to be disgusted by the monster kids ",
        "selftext": "This rant will contain spoilers for a more than forty year old movie. You have found the thread made by the one person in the world who is gonna write this serious essay on a silly children's movie no one has seen.Oh yeah.\n\nThe Garbage Pail Kids Movie is regarded as one of the worst movies ever made, due to the gross monster Kids, bad special effects, and ridiculous dialogue. It's not available to stream anywhere, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon because there's a reboot on the way. But having finally watched it for free on a site, I just want to say the thing I found most horrible about this children's movie.\n\nThat is, the movie has a good message about opposing bigotry and not judging people by how they look...but they completely botch it by making the Garbage Kids monsters worthy of hate & disgust. ​Throughout the movie, we are told that the poor Garbage Kids have to stay hidden in a little shop, because normal humans will attack them for being different. Normal humans are called \"Normies\" by the monsters & the movie constantly lectures that Normies are cruel & judgmental to anything ugly or gross. Only the main human boy (who is bullied) and the wise man who keeps the monster kids hidden in the shop are portrayed as tolerant and good at the start of the film.\n\nThe boy gets the idea to teach the world that the monsters are good, by having them put on a fashion show to the public. They invite several beautiful women to pose as models in the beautiful ​clothes that the monsters make - though it should be noted the models don't know anything about who made the clothes, this will come up again later. The boy helps the monsters get out of the shop so they can have fun in the Normie world. They are told to be careful, because normal humans are mean, something like that.\n\nOnly...\n\nThis is the part of the movie where the people making it decided to be goofy and show off all the gross things the Garbage Pail Kids can do. There is a Missie, a girl monster with a constantly runny nose who can sneeze a flood of snot, Windy Winston, a boy monster ho wears a Hawaiian shirt and often farts great visible cloud of gas violently; Valerie Vomit, a girl who throws up on command; Foul Phil, a whining hungry baby with who constantly asks characters if they are his \"mommy\" or \"daddy\"; Nat Nerd, an obese-acne riddled boy who dresses up like a superhero and wets his pants frequently; and on and on. All of these are exaggerated with ridiculous special effects. Apparently, because this is a kid's movie, the people making it thought it would be funny to spend forty minutes in the middle of the movie having these little monsters run around sneezing special effects snot showers, farting clouds of gas, and peeing on normies.\n\nNow, there ARE bullies and an evil police force that attack the monsters for being ugly - I'm not defending them. They are the villains and get what they deserve. They are not justified.\n\nBut there are several scenes where the Garbage Kids harass normal humans for no reason, and we are supposed to laugh and be on the Kids side. It's all played for laughs - nearly an hour in the second act of gag after gag. In one scene, The Garbage ​Kids walk into a movie theater crowded with normal humans. The humans don't attack or harass the Kids, they just keep watching the film. ​The Garbage Kids start being obnoxious. One of them steal an old woman's hot dog when she isn't noticing. Another steals a young woman's hot dog, and she notices, and her boyfriend is about to punch the thief, when he's ganged up on by another Garbage Pail Kid. Then Missy (the girl monster) comes into the theater with popcorn and sneezes a shower of snot all over the women and men in the room, causing all the normal humans to flee in disgust and horror. The main boy of the movie doesn't ever rebuke the monster kids for this, he says he's glad they had fun & hopes to let them out again.\n\nThen the bully boy, the villain of the film with the help of a traitor steal the dresses that the Garbage Pail Kids made for the upcoming fashion show. Not because he wants to wear the dresses himself, but so he and his partner can get credit for making these dresses when the beautiful human models wear them at the fashion show.\n\nIn the third act of the movie, the Garbage Pail Kids crash the fashion show, take out the bully, and...attack the women models. Yep, you read that right. In an attempt to show maybe that looks don't make you good or bad, the director decided to have his \"hero\" ugly monster kids chase beautiful normal human models around for the climax. But these models aren't the villains! They were contacted to wear he dresses for the fashion show that the boy himself helped set up, and that's what they are doing! Yet now our hero leads the monster kids in a \"payback\" attack on the very models for the event he helped organize! We're supposed to think it's justified due to the villain stealing credit and hosting the show once the models arrived. ​\n\nI walked away thinking that the Garbage Pail Kids monsters are a bunch of obnoxious thugs completely deserving of the fear and contempt most normal humans have of them.",

It could be described as a story taking place entirely around a family dealing with the reality that they could be losing their business soon or it could be described as a affectionate tale of human relationships across all universes, encompassing all the times that anyone or anything has ever lived through or experienced and how at the end, sometimes we forget that people love and care about us and we just see them opposing us because we have been so caught up in our own problems and shut everyone out that maybe we just weren’t paying attention to how much they were trying to be with us too.\n\nI don’t know how to explain it because the movie doesn’t try to either, there are no explanations at the end about the love we feel for eachother and not everything is right, there will still be fighting, there will still be moments where we will hate eachother but ultimately, as long as long we are kind and we listen to eachother, it will be okay.

        "title": "My favorite scene in Suicide Squad (2016)",
        "selftext": "I’m not even mad at 2016’s Suicide Squad. It’s actually really impressive that they made a movie where every single decision that went into making it was a bad decision. I’m familiar with the Suicide Squad comics somewhat and one of my back pocket rants is how I would give the movie the script doctor treatment, but that’s not what I’m here to talk about today. I’m here to talk about the one scene in 2016’s Suicide Squad that I thought was genuinely not bad, maybe even great if it had been in a better movie.\n\nThe first act of Suicide Squad is notoriously bloated, trying and often failing to introduce us to all of the members of the titular suicide squad and explain how Waller managed to get them to agree to be in the squad. The role of Deadshot is played by Will Smith, who I thought was terribly miscast in this movie but who is still Will Smith so the performance is nonetheless not bad. In his recruitment scene, they take Deadshot to a makeshift gun range, with a table full of different guns and several metal targets down range, and instruct him to pick up a gun and show them what he can do. Deadshot picks up a pistol, loads it, and immediately points it at Riggs, the guard who’d been abusing him for much of stay in prison. There’s a tense moment where Deadshot speculates that the gun must be loaded with blanks, because they wouldn’t give a loaded gun to a prisoner like him, but he fires into the air and discovers that the gun is indeed loaded with live ammunition. Deadshot immediately comes alive, pointing the weapon down range and going to town on the target dummies before doing the same with the other weapons on the table. Of course, every shot hits directly in the middle of the forehead, so accurate that he eventually punches holes in the metal.\n\nWhat I love is that, for a brief second, we get a real glimpse into Deadshot’s character that we never seem to get anywhere else in the movie, even when they’re actually trying to tell us about his character. The moment when he realizes he has a real gun loaded with real bullets in his hand, he doesn’t think of killing Riggs, though he has plenty of reason to do so. Instead, he forgets about everything and is consumed with firing the guns in front of him, with the precision of a pro athlete and the finesse of a paintbrush in the hands of a master painter. This is a man who has mastered the art of gunplay, a man who’s so skilled with firearms that they are an extension of his will, a means for expression in the same way that Bruce Lee expresses himself through martial arts. Deadshot’s been in prison and deprived of his tools for so long that when he finally gets a loaded gun in his hand he gets totally consumed with the rush of using his skills again, like a caged cheetah being released so it can run again.\n\nI wish that they had explored Deadshot’s character more, maybe explored exactly how much he thinks of himself as either a simple mercenary doing a job or a psychopathic man who just really loves shooting people. I wish that they’d let Deadshot’s character just be who he is instead of forcing him into the mold of a classic Will Smith “father with a heart of gold” character. I wish they had done a lot of things differently when they made Suicide Squad the movie. But this is one scene in a bad movie that I did not hate, and in fact actually made me light up with the potential of what the movie could have been.",

His best friend played by Orlando Jones. Sean william Scott basically plays stiffler if he wanted to be a fireman but it works, Julianne Moore is a ice cold but clumsy scientist. It's an alien invasion movie with some really nice special effects and imagination. Most of all, it's really really funny. From \"the main madness\" ro Orlando having some great lines, all the characters click for me. Definitely check it out.

        "selftext": "I'm looking for movies about paranormal investigators. Movies with a serious tone, not necessarily slow-burn, with good cinematography similar to the Conjuring series, The Innkeepers, Exhuma, The Ninth Gate, Red Lights, Constantine (2005), which feature paranormal investigators as protagonists. They can be realistic or not. I'm also interested in films with regular detectives investigating the paranormal, like the series Twin Peaks, The X-Files,  and the movies Longlegs and The Wailing.\n\nAlso they can be involving fictional organizations that investigate the paranormal like the Dharma Initiative in the Lost series.\n\nAnything about poltergeists, ghosts, UFOs and aliens, parallel dimensions, spirits, unexplainable forces, occult, parapsychology, including both supernatural and paranormal elements. \n\nAlso in the style of Alan Wake and Control games.\n\nI'm also open (not so open) to movies with a more comedic tone, like Ghostbusters, The Frighteners, Men in Black? and the Dirk Gently series, they still need to have a spooky atmosphere. However, I really prefer films with a more serious tone.\n\nHope you got what i am searching for.\n\nPlease NOT found footage horror films, i hate that style of directing",

Growing up in the 90s, the VHS was always playing at my relatives home, and always caught glimpses of it but never really watched it.

The shots captured in film of the Hong Kong landscape really did it for me, it reminds me of a time that has long gone. The busy streets and large electronics store signs.\n\nWatching movies like Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Goonies never made me feel nostalgic or scratch that itch for me. Maybe because I grew up in a busy cosmopolitan environment (I know Ghostbusters is set in the city). It's weird, because those movies were big in the early 90s when I was growing up. \n\nContrastingly, Jackie Brown had the same effect on me. I only watched it last week and I can't get it out of my mind. I put it on because I had some time away from the kids and I told myself rather than scrolling endlessly trying to pick a movie, I'll watch the first film that pops up on my streaming service.

Some said that, when factoring in on-demand and potential disc sales, that the movie would be more successful and possibly spawn a sequel.\n\nHowever, is it really a factor? I know in the past, DVD sales have breathed new life into movies after their theatrical runs. But today, when some retailers are minimizing disc stock, I find it hard to believe disc sales are a substantial metric. I've no idea how impactful on-demand sales are, but it seems like using streaming figures for  theatrically released movies as a measure of success isn't right. After all, if people are only willing to view a movie when it's on streaming, why bother with spending so much money on marketing and distribution?",

        "title": "Passengers had so much potential but it just slowly devolved into trash [Spoiler review]",
        "selftext": "Spoiler review/rant, so if you for some reason want to see it first, don't proceed further.\n\nThis movie had such an interesting premise. The first half an hour was honestly pretty damn good, before it hits you that they kinda don't know how to expand on it. Because honestly it kinda IS hard to expand on the story in a setting that doesn't change much, by nature.\n\nThe movie presents us with a very flawed protagonist, but that's good! Having a flaw as gigantic as subjecting Aurora to his fate just so he would feel less lonely, is pretty interesting and leaves a lot of room to grow and to have some fascinating discussion.\n\nThe part where they're dating feels scummy, and I thought it was intentionally so, but given the rest of the movie, it seems like the writers totally wanted us to see it as romantic and cute, and if that's the case then EWWWWW. Jim pretty much took Aurora's life and agency away from her and they want us to be happy about them dating now? Eventually Aurora finds out and is totally pissed off, and that's the only cathartic part of the movie (and even that's undermined later). She doesn't want anything to do with him and spends most ify her time on the other side of the ship. \n\nEventually, the Captain (I think he was named Gus?) wakes up and that's the turning point where they introduce more of the plot. The ship is having a breakdown and they have to fix it before the 5000 passengers die. However, after like 15 minutes, Gus fucking dies so he's really just more of a plot device to give the main characters access to the crew/staff rooms. Shame, because he might have expanded greatly on the dynamic. Then they shoot his corpse into space for some reason? Come on, guys, maybe the crew would've wanted to give him proper burial on Homestead 2? I don't recall him saying he wants his corpse to float in interplanetary space for an eternity so it's another decision that feels un-consensual. \n\nFinally there's the climax where Jim almost sacrifices himself, etc. Not much to say here, other than that the use of the Law of Conversation of Momentum was pretty clever, I liked that. A lot of space movies don't acknowledge that throwing something heavy in space will provide force on yourself in the opposite direction. \n\nAurora revives Jim, and here comes the ending, that is just the dumbest part of the whole movie. Jim figures out a way to put someone into cryo-sleep using the Auto-Doctor. However THERE'S ONLY 1 AUTO-DOCTOR ON THE ENTIRE SHIP, that houses FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. Putting aside that the \"emotional\" finale hinges itself on the dumbest thing ever, Jim offers Aurora to freeze her so she can have her life back. However, for some reason she loves him again and actually wants to die with him on the ship. Wtf? This was an opportunity for Jim to actually redeem himself, sacrifice the life he could've had so he could give Aurora hers back. Aurora, still hating him, would've accepted and later wrote about him in an article retelling the story, as the flawed individual he was, but who ultimately saved the ship and redeemed himself in the end. BUT NOOOOOOO, THEY'RE IN LOVEEE!!! \n\nSo anyway, we have a flashback to the future and they planted a bunch of trees in the hall, recorded a bunch of messages for the passengers and presumably died. They didn't show *how* they died tho, altough it would be funny to just see a pair of skeletons chilling in the cafeteria. But like, did they die of old age? And if so, they didn't die at the same exact time, did they? Once one of them died, the other one didn't really have anything holding them there and could've put themselves to sleep in the auto-doctor??? So yeah, confused-ass movie, with a weird-ass ending.\n\nSorry for my rant, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out and see what's the general consensus on the movie.",

It’s one of those films that’s forgettable, yet manages to still be somewhat enjoyable. However, i can assure you it won´t go in the \"forgettable\" Camp like ***Dwayne Johnson´s*** ***Rampage***).\n\nI stumbled upon it back when i first got Netflix, around 2015 or so, and it became one of the earliest, or maybe first movies i watched on this platform. Since that first viewing, i’ve come back to it maybe four times. Yet, oddly enough, each time i rewatch it, i seem to forget many parts of it and especially how exactly the finale unfolds.\n\nThe premise of ***Spectral*** is one of those science fiction setups that’s both intriguing and familiar. The story follows a team of soldiers, scientists, and engineers as they investigate mysterious, ghostly apparitions that have begun to kill people in a war-torn Eastern European City. While the story leans heavily on Sci-Fi and war movie tropes, it does enough to set itself apart with an air of mystery around these spectral entities. It has a unique twist, but admittedly, not groundbreaking or especially innovative.\n\nOne of ***Spectral's*** surprising strengths is it´s CGI. The visual effects are well done, it brings a lot of atmosphere, adding a otherworldly feel to the visuals, which would probably be harder to pull off with practical effects.\n\nThe cast and performances is solid.  \n***James Badge Dale*** takes the lead, and while his role isn’t going to win any awards, he does a good job carrying the movie. The supporting cast fills in their roles well too, though none of them particularly stand out to me in terms of character development or memorable moments. They serve the plot without drawing too much attention to themselves, which is fitting for a movie of this genre but may contribute to why ***Spectral*** tends to be easily forgotten.\n\nThe Soundtrack was written by the infamous Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL), but i didn´t really managed to hear any standout cues in it. It mostly just plays in the background (which is the point, isn´t it?).\n\nSo at least, ***Spectral*** in the end is a fun, but sadly ultimately forgettable ride. It doesn’t do anything to redefine Sci-Fi or military action, but it doesn’t do anything particularly wrong either. If you’re in the mood for a visually engaging action thriller with a Sci-Fi twist, it’s a solid choice that’s likely worth a rewatch or two. But if you’re looking for something that leaves a lasting impact on you or a complex storyline, ***Spectral*** might not fully deliver.",

        "selftext": "“The Godfather” trilogy and “Apocalypse Now” filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola will be the 50th recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award.\n\nThe American Film Institute (AFI) Board of Trustees announced that Coppola will presented the award — the institution’s highest honor for a career in film — during a gala tribute ceremony held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on April 26, 2025.\n\n“Francis Ford Coppola is a peerless artist — one who has created seminal works in the canon of American film, and has also inspired generations of filmmakers who now embody his artistry and his independent spirit,” stated Kathleen Kennedy, chair of the AFI board of trustees.\n\nCoppola is a six-time Academy Award-winning writer, director and producer (including the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the AMPAS board of governors), with an acclaimed filmography that also includes “The Conversation,” “The Outsiders” and “Bram Stoker’s Dracula.” Coppola’s latest film “Megalopolis,” launched earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival and was released theatrically and in Imax globally this fall. Three of his films, “The Godfather,” “The Godfather Part II” and “Apocalypse Now” rank among AFI’s “100 Years… 100 Movies” list, as well as Variety’s 100 best films list.\n\nAs the co-founder of American Zoetrope with George Lucas, Coppola’s impact can also be measured by the careers of the filmmakers he’s supported (including Carroll Ballard, John Milius and Sofia Coppola, his daughter) as well as actors such as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, James Caan, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfus, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Matt Dillon, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nEstablished in 1973, the AFI Life Achievement Award is presented to a single honoree “whose talent has in a fundamental way advanced the film art; whose accomplishment has been acknowledged by scholars, critics, professional peers and the general public; and whose work has stood the test of time.” Recent recipients include Nicole Kidman (2024), Julie Andrews (2022), Denzel Washington (2019), George Clooney (2018) and Diane Keaton (2017).\n\nThe AFI Life Achievement Award Tribute special will air on TNT, with encore presentations on Turner Classic Movies (TCM).\n\nhttps://variety.com/2024/film/news/film-news-in-brief-oct-28-2024-1236192406/",

If you go to IMDB and search under his name, it does list the movie, but says he’s uncredited. It’s a smaller part but not so small it should have been uncredited. Does anyone know if there’s a particular reason he’s not in the cast list? Did he hate the movie and not want to be associated with it? Just curious, thanks. ",

A 70 minute little sci-fi/horror treat.\n\n\nThis movie lives and dies by the performance of it's titular lead, the Invisible Man, Jack Griffin himself, and Claude Rains absolutely delivers on that front. He's unhinged, charismatic and also sympathetic. And all that from physical acting and voice work. Also the costume rules. The bandage and glasses combo is so good.\n\n\nI didn't know the story of the Invisible Man. I'm intrigued to check out the source material. What a clever and horrifying story about being invisible. The chaos escalate really quickly. \n\n\nThe cinematography and effects look amazing too. It's really fun to think about how they managed to do all those special effects almost 90 years ago and try to figure out some of the tricks.\n\n\nI saw The Mummy 1932 a while ago as well, that one was pretty good too, but this might be my favourite 30's monster movie.\n\n",

That road scene couldve hit a lot harder if i watched it alone tbh",

The prequel movies were also so bad that people hated George Lucas for it. \n\nAnother example is the 1993 Super Mario bros movie. People are seeming warming up to the belief that the movie was a ok movie based on the most popular video game franchises in history when in truth that movie had bad production, horrible plot, and completely misses the point of the Mario bros franchise completely and people literally hated it at the time. \n\nCan you give and example of a movie that was revisioned into history and explained what really happened when the movie was released and made?

I've tried on my Letterboxd account but I can't do it anymore. Like, I find it genuinely stupid to attribute stars, or a note /10, /20 whatever, to a movie? Imo, art is not meant to be graded, it is meant to be appreciated and evaluated by technical criterias. You can explain why you appreciate, or not, a movie, why it fails, or not, in its mission, but I feel like the ratings are too objective for something as subjective as evaluating a film (especially nowadays, where ratings can create, or serve, free hate movements against a film on the internet). It would be like giving a score to a painting, or to music, something we rarely do btw, it doesn't make sense in my mind? \n\nI am of course open to respectful discussion, and why not be convinced, what do you think? 🙂",

He is super creepy and funny at the same time, but unfortunately the movies itself are pretty boring/trashy, so we didnt enjoyed them pretty much. (Pls dont hate us, lol)\n\nSo is Terrifier 3 somewhat differen, or just more of the same? We are bored that there is no real exciting plot to follow, just people who get killed (Even Part 2 tryied to tell more story then part 1). Also it seems like there are no real rules about Art & his Skills in Surviveabillity. When we watching The First movie i was like \"Pls, dont make him supernatural\" and in the end... you know, he comes back. In Movie #2 he get even more \"killed\" and still be alive, kinda lame.\n\nIf the killer would have been not as funny as Art we prob would have stopped watching. The gore isnt a problem, even if its way over the top and just stupid. Its the plot/storytelling, what is pretty boring.",

        "selftext": "It's Halloween. Most people are watching ghost movies or slasher flicks or creature features but in my house, we sit with a glass of elderberry wine and watch the 1944 classic *Arsenic and Old Lace*.\n\nFor those who don't know it, Cary Grant plays recently-married critic Mortimer Brewster who returns home to his elderly aunts on Halloween only to discover that they've been poisoning lonely old men in the neighbourhood. Complications arise from his brothers (one who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and the other who looks like Boris Karloff).\n\nTaking place in (more or less) a single set, it's a wonderful screwball comedy. Completely over the top acting, especially from Grant. I know that he wasn't fond of his performance, but I think he's got the perfect mix of serious and madcap. The deadpan delivery from much of the supporting cast sells the comedy.\n\nThe MO of the aunts is incredible: they are perfectly believable as serial killers who murder out of misplaced mercy. In a time before formal criminal profiling, their behaviours seem exceedingly accurate. \n\nThe plot doesn't meander much, although there are a few extraneous characters, such as the Reverend living next door (Mortimer's new father-in-law), who only appears in a single scene. He could have been cut or else developed further. \n\nOverall, a wonderfully silly alternative Halloween movie.",

But I've found that if you really search there are some intentionally good films in all genres on Netflix. However they more than often don't end up being that memorable. I read the plot and it sounds really intriguing and original but the final product often is undercooked or just should have been better. Plus I hate it that they all have that sterile Netflix sheen in the film grain (or lack of). Last night I watched I Came By that was okay but could and should have been so much better and I know I'll never watch it again. A better one was Leave no Trace. These are films that are good for two hours entertainment but aren't going to have much lasting impression.\n\nDoes anyone else find this?  ",

When directors of Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar etc win awards, do these awards go to the people mentioned or do the companies take them and put them on their showcase? Like for Spiderverse they gave 5 academy awards to the directors and producers, so I think it's strange that the studio takes 5 Awards of the same type for the same film. But at the same time, I've seen other awards shows (The Golden Globe) that only gave one trophy to a couple of directors and they weren't married. They were working partners. So how these awards work?",

Here's 3 I wish got talked about more\n\nEdison (2005)\n\nGame 6 (2006)\n\nBlindspotting (2018)\n\nI know Blindspotting got a TV show, but I don't see anybody talking about either one. Edison was Justin Timberlake's film debut and he's acting alongside Kevin Spacey, Dylan McDermott (who is absolutely FANTASTIC in it) and Morgan Freeman and I think he holds his own. Game 6 was released 2 years before RDJ became Iron Man, so he hadn't quite become a household name and it also stars Michael Keaton, who had made a name for himself as Beetlejuice and Batman. It's set in 1986 New York, game 6 of the World Series that year. They are 3 I will always try to recommend to people. ",

I tried to pick culturally significant horror movies. After watching each one, I reviewed and ranked them.  I decided to give a one to ten number rating each movie's scare value (S), how disturbing (disgusting or revolting imagery, actions or themes) the movie is (D), and how fun the movie is to watch (F).  Lastly, I ranked them in order of my least to most favorite movie overall.  I considered overall quality and not necessarily the S, D and F ratings to make my final rankings at the bottom of the post.\n\n\n\nI'm interested in feedback and would love to see others rank these movies as well!  Minor spoilers in the reviews.\n\n\n\nOct 1st: Halloween 2018. Solid soundtrack, Jamie Lee Curtis forever! I enjoyed the revenge plot and the cat and mouse play.  Entertaining, but a bit ridiculous.  I had a great time, but this isn't high minded stuff.  I realize now that I probably should have watched the original first.  S 3, D 4, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 2nd: The Blair Witch Project.  I feel like this was only a hit because it pulled off the hand held faux docu-movie in a way that fooled the public because it was relatively unique at the time. I was bored, and not scared. Maybe it would have been different if I'd watched it in 1999 and thought it was an actual documentary.  S 2, D 1, F 1.\n\n\n\nOct 3rd: The Witch.  Eggers clearly has a style (I've seen The Northman).  This was creepy and engaging, and had some real gross and memorable scenes, especially involving children and an infant.  I feel like the ending didn't pack as much of a wallop as the build-up seemed to promise, although it still hit well enough with a memorable closing shot.  Eggers clearly was going for arthouse horror and succeeded.  Also, thank you for bringing us Anya Taylor-Joy.  S 6, D 8, F 4.\n\n\n\nOct 4th: Nightmare on Elm Street. Eighties camp, here we are. Disco electronica soundtrack, Johnny Depp's massive blood volume, and a memorable but not that scary villain.  Didn't age incredibly well, but fun for what it is. S 3, D 4, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 5th: Friday the 13th. This one was kinda dumb.  Maybe the sequels are better, since I suppose they have more Jason.  But I did get to see Kevin Bacon get an arrow slow-pushed through his cricoid, so there's that. S 2, D 3, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 6th: Hereditary. Jeesh.  This is peak disturbing, especially *that* scene, taken together with the characters' upsetting responses.  Ari Aster clearly knows how to upset his audience.  I wish there was more exposition around the mythology and story in a way that made the movie's plot and ending more immediately accessible.  Still, Toni Collette was incredible and this movie seems deserving of its modern horror classic designation. S 9, D 10, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 7th: Midsommar.  Two Ari Asters in a row.  This time he nails disturbing with crazy memorable images in the opening, middle, and closing sections. I didn't know a movie could be so upsetting without resorting to dark rooms and hallways. Also, Florence Pugh's closing expression, yikes.  S 6, D 10, F 5.\n\n\n\nOct 8th: Psycho. This is a pretty excellent movie.  I've never seen Hitchcock before this month.  I recognize why he's one of the greats after watching this.  The plot twist is great.  The lead up and execution of the famous shower scene is great.  The script and acting are great.  Bravo.  S 6, D 5, F 4.\n\n\n\nOct 9th: The Birds.  This Hitchcock didn't do it for me.  Birds ultimately just aren't that scary.  I couldn't buy into the plot device or the romance at the center.  But filming all the birds must have been pretty tricky! S 3, D 3, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 10th: The Shining.  Peak horror.  Nicholson at his best.  The story, the style, the imagery, the scares are all spot on and memorable in the best ways.  It feels like a work of art.  I wish Kubrick had done more straight horror.  That said, he could have helped Shelley Duvall with her \"scared running\" technique a little.  S 8, D 6, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 11th: The Exorcist. I've grown up hearing that this is the scariest movie ever.  After watching, I get it.  That possessed girl is not cool.  Ellen Burstyn is fantastic.  Some of those scenes are absolutely unforgettable.  How was this made in 1973?  Deserved its best picture nom.  Horrifying.  Do not recommend.  S 10, D 9, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 12th: Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is just fine movie making.  I can see how this influenced so many horror movies to come.  Incredible dinner table scene, and the closing shot is clearly iconic.  This movie has aged almost perfectly, with the chase scene being the only exception (could have done with a few less clips of him running after her through the trees).  S 5, D 8, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 13th: Rosemary's Baby. So, she was raped by Satan?  Ok then.  Honestly, this is obviously elite direction, writing, character development and acting.  The movie was clearly way ahead of its time for horror. The ending is disturbing and effective. I imagine this movie is even more upsetting to those who've experienced pregnancy, especially as Rosemary is being manipulated by her husband and doctors.  I know I can never show this one to my wife. I'm no movie historian, but I understand why this is on a lot of all-time best movie lists.  S 3, D 8, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 14th: The Mist. Pretty standard, kinda fun and scary creature flick until that ending. I'm sure the ending has been talked about ad nauseum because it is so impactful and shocking. Let me just say this: it made me feel physically ill.  It's burned in my head forever now. I'm not sure I'm happy about it. And isn't that what a good horror is supposed to do?  S 5, D 10, F 5.\n\n\n\nOct 15th: It (2017).  I haven't seen the original, but I thought this movie was really solid.  Steven King knows how to weave a yarn.  Seems to me this movie is the reason that Stranger Things exists, and it did the \"80s kids on bikes who outshine and outsmart the adults\" thing as well as it can be done.  Real solid scares too, that clown is creep town.  Some of the scare set pieces felt a little forced, though.  S 8, D 6, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 16th: Get Out.  I think the social commentary delivery by this movie is pitch perfect. The plot is well done with an engaging cast, and there are some nice shocking reveals. The movie built suspense well, is perfectly directed, and kept me engaged throughout. This is a solid horror. However, I may have expected more than I got given all the awards and recognition hype. S 6, D 6, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 17th:  Paranormal Activity. Really freaked me out for some reason. The nanny cam view capturing spooky stuff at night messing with oblivious people sleeping in their bed captures one of my unreasonable fears by violating my primary safe space, my room. I don't like it.  Other than the scare device, though, there's not much to this movie.  S 9, D 2, F1.\n\n\n\nOct 18th: Nope. Unpopular opinion alert: This is my pick between the two Jordan Peele movies I watched.  I love this movie so much. It is riotously funny in parts and pretty atmospheric and frightening in others. I can't take my eyes off of Daniel Kaluuya, he's so intense. I love the juxtaposing stories all driving home the message that non-human intelligent beings (whether chimps, horses, or aliens) don't exist just to be gawked at by a paying human public. They just might get their revenge.  What a ride.   S 7, D 5, F 9.\n\n\n\nOct 19th:  It Follows.  The best premise to a horror flick I've ever seen or heard of. Of course there should be a movie about a horror STD.  And it happens to be expertly executed.  The movie managed to get under my skin by exploiting my fear of being followed.  It crafts a sense of dread because the bad guy can always be anyone and it never stops walking toward you unless you have sex to pass the scourge onto someone you might really care about.  Talk about moral dilemmas.  If any horror movie deserves a sequel, it's this one. C'mon David Robert Mitchell, give us \"It Still Follows,\" we would all watch it.  S 8, D 7, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 20th: Talk To Me.  From the jump, this flick knows how to shock and build suspense.  It has a couple of pretty memorable frightening moments and manages to stay creepy, with a solid ending.  I'm learning that people getting possessed is a really scary thing for me to watch, and this movie has that in spades.  This is a lesser known horror gem IMO.  S 9, D 8, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 21st:  Scream.  The opening was destined to become a classic moment in horror. This is meant to be a fun self-aware movie, with clever horror genre references throughout and a twist for the reveal.  And lots and lots of stabbing.  I definitely had a good time.  Not very scary though.  S 3, D 3, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 22nd:  The Thing.  Yes!  Inject this into my veins.  Would make a perfect double feature with Alien.  Everything was just right: Kurt Russell's paranoia, John Carpenter's direction, Rob Bottin's creature work, the suspicion created by the genius plot device, the chill-to-the-bone setting, and the perfectly ambiguous ending.  I love this movie.  S 6, D 8, F 10.\n\n\n\nOct 23rd:  Saw.  This is where the Escape Rooms trend came from?  My kids thank you, Saw.  This was a fun ride with a clever ending. Also, why don't people with one leg ever stand and hop in the movies? Dragging themselves around smh.  S 6, D 7, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 24th:  Barbarian.  What the?  I honestly didn't find it terribly scary, but it's high on the disturbing scale.  Props working in a \"me too\" theme.  The kill at the end was definitely a gruesome shocker.  But c'mon, that last set piece defies physics in too many ways to give it a pass.  S 4, D 8, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 25th:  Pearl.  Mia Goth's acting deserves a shout out for that closing credits clip alone. Not sure about the southern girl accent despite her being raised in relative isolation by her German speaking mother.  It feels a bit over the line manipulative, although I suppose that is partly the point, to feel ridiculously, sarcastically manipulated - but not fooled - by Pearl. Such an interesting movie. Lots of buildup to a pretty upsetting conclusion. I admire the risks it takes and the artistry it shows. Felt like pre-tornado Wizard of Oz with a Return to Oz below-the-surface creepiness.  S 4, D 8, F 5.\n\n\n\nOct 26th:  Sinister.  I read a study that tried to scientifically prove which horror movie is the scariest based on the heart rate increase of the audience. Sinister was officially named by the study authors as the Most Scary Movie. So I watched it. And, yes, it's pretty high up on the list for me. The soundtrack is pulsating, the family snuff videos awful, and the darkness prevalent. The movie is almost all in the dark. Ethan Hawke is always excellent. The end reveal is mostly predictable, but this movie definitely delivers the scares. Edit: This movie ended up freaking me out so bad I had trouble sleeping and had to watch some SNL at 1am to settle down.  S 10, D 7, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 27th:  Hellraiser (1987).  It tried to be an interesting \"how far would you go to get what you most want\" movie, which is more theme than most of the other 80's horror I watched this month. Most of the runtime I was thinking \"dang, the makeup and creature effects are really good for '87\" and then the special effects at the end made me want to take it all back. Overall pretty disturbing and gruesome, and fairly well done without being very scary.  But the ending was a dud in almost every way.  S 3, D 8, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 28th: Candyman (1992).  I went in with low expectations after being burned by Hellraiser, and the movie beat them comfortably. I thought it was really solid. I loved the soundtrack, the villain was memorable, and the plot was tightly wound and appropriately suspenseful.  It even mostly stuck the landing.  S 6, D 6, F 7.\n\n\n\nOct 29th:  The Descent.  I saw this one mentioned a lot so I gave it a go and I'm glad I did.  It's like A Quiet Place but dialed up to 11 with its pitch black cave setting, claustrophobia, and bloody violent (and quite upsetting) kills.  The action in this movie is breathtaking in spots.  A plot choice made at the end really upset me, which makes the film all the more memorable.  S 9, D 7, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 30th: The Wicker Man (1973).  Not sure what I was expecting with this one, but it wasn't the cross between a hyper-sexualized The Sound of Music and Midsommar that I got. Overall a bit slow and unscary but turns the corner in the last 20 minutes with an incredibly impactful ending that really delves into questions of the ethics of religious piety and perspective. And it was super cool to watch a Christopher Lee masterclass from his younger days.  S 1, D6, F2. \n\n\n\nOct 31st (watched it yesterday):  The Evil Dead (1981). Oh wow. Ok. Well, Sam Raimi certainly did some stuff here!  Nice use of fog and camera perspective work, and the creature makeup is crazy. This movie has some hilariously messed up images and kills. I didn't know whether to laugh or freak out or throw up through most of it.  And the gore.  Oh, the gore.  It was often hard to distinguish whether it's high camp or high art, and maybe it's both.  This movie obviously birthed a lot of horror tropes.  I can't believe what I just watched.  And I can't believe I almost didn't watch it, being the last film on the list.  S 7, D 10, F 7.\n\n\n\nOverall Rankings:\n\n\n\n31: Friday the 13th\n\n\n\n30: The Blair Witch Project\n\n\n\n29: The Birds\n\n\n\n28: Nightmare on Elm Street\n\n\n\n27: Hellraiser\n\n\n\n26: Paranormal Activity\n\n\n\n25: Barbarian\n\n\n\n24: Halloween (2018)\n\n\n\n23: Scream\n\n\n\n22: The Wicker Man (1973)\n\n\n\n21: The Mist\n\n\n\n20: It (2017)\n\n\n\n19: The Witch\n\n\n\n18: Sinister\n\n\n\n17: Pearl\n\n\n\n16: Saw\n\n\n\n15: Candyman (1992)\n\n\n\n14: Talk to Me\n\n\n\n13: Midsommar\n\n\n\n12: Get Out\n\n\n\n11: The Evil Dead (1981)\n\n\n\n10: Hereditary\n\n\n\n9: Psycho\n\n\n\n8: The Descent\n\n\n\n7: The Exorcist\n\n\n\n6: Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\n\n\n5: It Follows\n\n\n\n4: Nope\n\n\n\n3: Rosemary's Baby\n\n\n\n2: The Thing\n\n\n\n1: The Shining\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did I get right or wrong?

        "title": "Movies Thriller Recommendations? (Home Invasions)",
        "selftext": "I saw a movie called *Hush (2016)* a while back and I'm no horror watcher at all, but that was a great watch for me. The thing about horror movies like *Hereditary* or *Midsommar* is that the plot is \"ambiguous\" (to me at least) and they rely on effects and creepy stuff to drive the movie. That stuff doesn't do it to me because I watch movies to be immersed in a streamline plot. The problem for me with popular horror movies like *Nightmare on Elm Street* or *Friday the 13th* is that the antagonists are literally unbeatable so you're basically just watching a slaughter fest and when the protagonist actually \"survives\", the antagonist was never really defeated. When it came to *Hush*, the \"home invasion\" idea really does it for me. The plot is straight forward enough to make you wonder what's going to happen next, they keep you at the edge of your seat without having to use crazy gore or fantasy elements, and the antagonist is just a human being that can **die**. Just the idea of someone breaking into your house and something plot driven makes it even scarier to me because it's almost like \"damn this can happen to me.\"\n\nI wanted to watch something along those lines, but didn't even know what to look up so I just stopped watching the horror genre again. Now that it's Halloween, I recently watched *Speak No Evil (2024 remake)* with a couple of friends and it was exactly along the lines of what I was looking for back when I watched *Hush*. Plot made sense, good resolution to the movie, and I was anxious the whole time (and bonus, it didn't rely on a jump scare every few minutes).\n\nNow I really want to watch more movies just like that and I figured this sub was the best place to ask. Any movie recommendations for a horror/thriller like this where the plot is straight forward, the ending doesn't leave you with \"what if?\", and isn't driven by fantasy elements like demons or immortal unbeatable antagonists?\n\n\\*\\*Just wanted to make a note that these opinions are my own. Some people might find the plot to, let's say, *Midsommar* to be straight forward, but to me it wasn't. I'm a simple man and don't want to be confused by eerie elements thrown at me.",

I've asked you for the most popular movie set in Belgium, and in a way, *C'est arrivé près de chez vous* (or as it was titled in English-language distribution: *Man bites dog*), could have been the clear winner here,  If I would have add up all the upvotes (minus the downvotes) for comments that put it in the mix... but that's not how this game is played. Instead, I looked up which movie was mentioned in the top comment. And, of course, it was ***In Bruges*** \\- I should have bet money.\n\nToday I hope that there will be less confusion about who has already named which title and when. But it's definitely going to be exciting, because unlike yesterday, I don't have a film on my screen today that I think could win the race here. Today it's about your most favorite movie set in **Bosnia and Herzegovina** and the rules are the same as everyday:\n\n* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.\n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 7: Belgium - In Bruges  \nDay 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)  \nDay 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu  \nDay 4: Austria - Funny Games  \nDay 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.

Motel Hell is a one off with a great central premise and main villains who are at once horrifyingly efficient yet kinda likeable and funny. Not gonna give away any spoilers but if you like that era of horror and haven’t seen it do yourself a favor and check it out, Farmer Vincent would appreciate it.",

I'll give you an example: “Edward Scissorhands”, the sky in this film is very white in some scenes, not to mention the color palette. Another good example we have of this type of film are the scenes that take place in cemeteries. Imagine a wake, the camera is focused above, showing the characters' faces and the sky in the background, so it will certainly be very white and rainy, why is that?",

        "selftext": "Just finished watching Rebel Ridge and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I've heard good things and the film has high RT scores, but watching it, I thought it was a complete mess.\n\nRant incoming.\n\n  \nThe pacing is all over the place. I felt like I watched 3 different movies. It never really builds up to anything, it's just constant build with no payoff...\n\n  \nThe plot makes no sense and has way too much going on. They start this entire thread about Terry's cousin being mixed up with some gang he ratted out, which ends when he dies, okay, sure. Then there's some shady stuff going on with the Chinese restaurant with is clearly a front for something, which is never explained, just another thread left nowhere. Why do they give Terry money so easily? The police raid the Chinese food place over the phone, that does nowhere and is never mentioned again. Then there's the corruption of the cops stealing money due to some very specific lawsuit that happened and they keep prisoners for 90 days until the dash-cam footage deletes. At first they indicate the judge is pushing back against it, then he's in on it, then tries to commit suicide... okay. The entire \"scheme\" is super convoluted.\n\nTerry takes the deal from the Chief to leave town half way through the film, then decides more or less off-screen to change his mind and go full John Wick even though 5 minutes before he said he didn't give a shit about the corruption. There was no character moment for him to make that \"choice\". The cops drug Summer to keep her quiet, but not kill her, even though it would have made way more sense that they do and frame it as a junkie OD. \n\nIt's just all so much and so convoluted.\n\nThere was no character development for any character in the film at all. Every single character is 1-dimensional and starts exactly the same as they finish. You never learn any real backstory about Terry, other than he knows martial arts and was in the Marines, which also bothered me because they built it up like he was gonna be some Seal Team 6 bad ass, and he just knows martial arts, but a lot of Marines and military know martial arts, why he is \"special\".  They built him up to be some baba-yaga when he's really just an ordinary badass.\n\n  \nThen that ending, holy hell what was that!? Okay, the final shootout/action scene was bad-ass, and the main actor, is great in the role, but the \"ending\" sequence makes NO sense. \n\nFirst there's the \"reveal\" of Summers informant, Rory from the Office, which makes no sense. First of all, she had no idea a day before about any of the corruption dealings, it was not until she started looking into Terry's cousins case that she discovered the issue. Then all of a sudden, this STUDENT, ALMOST LAWYER, has an INFORMANT in the police force who is giving her inside information, and it turns out to be Rory, the guy who at the beginning of the film, was a corrupt douche who robs Terry and is CLEARLY in on the entire situation. This guy turns informant for a student, to rat out the operation he was involved in... why???\n\nThen the final \"chase\" scene, the chief calls in state police backup, says they need to get their story in first, all the cops take off after Terry & crew, with state police incoming, who as far as they know, are now chasing an armed assailant who attached multiple police officers and stole a police vehicle with 1 officer prisoner....\n\nThen the female officer has a change of heart, with no setup really, rams the Chief off the road and .... and that's it.\n\nAll the other corrupt cops, the state police just say \"Oh... well nevermind!\" and proceed to escort Terry & crew to the hospital and the movie ends.  There's no scene or indication any of the other cops are wavering or having a change of heart, no reason the state police would back off.\n\nYou also get no payoff with the Chief, the main Antagonist the entire film, he just sits in his car after getting rammed off the road. There's no final confrontation, no payoff.\n\nI feel like I watched a completely different film than everyone else, I honestly thought it was pretty underwhelming. 2 1/2 hours of buildup and no payoff, felt insulting.  \n",

        "selftext": "What the f\\*%$ happened to this sequel? It was all over the place. It's like they tried to do too many things in one movie. Like he tried to combine Schitt's Creek, Beetlejuice, and Wednesday into one shitty confusing plot. It's a simple movie, and you messed it up. You had everything you needed, all the good actors, the set, and you f&%$ed it up. Why did this almost turn into a teen love story? Who was the guy proposing to Lydia? How did he not know anything about her past. Too many side stories that nobody was buying. You covered the iconic house. Why did it take so long to summon Beetlejuice?\n\nFirst, I would've started with Lydia being a successful author who had to make public appearances, but didn't like doing that fake shit. Her fame was fading and she was hitting serious writer block. She is dark and strange, but doesn't care. She's not a fake ass talk show host. She's confident, but bored with her life. Her husband travels for work, but oh shit, he dies in a car accident. He comes back to the house not knowing he's dead, and she doesn't realize because she can see the dead. The rest of the world doesn't see him, but he can't leave the house. Sand worms. Sound familiar. Yeah, that's because I'm using the same theme as the prior movie. Which makes sense as a sequel.\n\nNow, her husband is having trouble. He can't move on. And they can't get it on. It's kind lame being dead. He doesn't want to live life as a ghost. So, she summons Beetlejuice in desperation. He shows up guns blazing. He's the same dirty old bastard and strikes up an interest with her daughter. Completely believable. She uses her power to put him back in his place, but he's not completely gone. The family tries to move past this shit and help their father. As they're trying to do different things to help their father live in his new reality, Beetlejuice is summoned again by a neighbor who also has an interest in the daughter. He falls into a trap that Beetlejuice lays out for him. Next thing you know, the daughter is supposed to wed Beetlejuice. Da ja vu. What happens next?\n\nThe OG film was art. It reflected reality in a fantastical way. The sequel is bulljuice.",

        "selftext": "*Note: I’ve divided this post into two sections - the first part that is SPOILER-FREE and the second with SPOILERS. If you haven’t seen \"The Devotion of Suspect X\" and want to watch it, I suggest skipping the SPOILERS section.*\n\nAbout a decade ago, I first watched *The Devotion of Suspect X*. I hadn’t heard much about it, just that it was an intriguing Japanese thriller worth checking out. Watching it for the first time, I was captivated; it was one of the most impressive international films I’d ever seen. Even now, it remains a favorite. The movie has inspired remakes across several countries like Korea, China, and India, and I’ve tried to catch each one. While these versions each bring something new, the original Japanese adaptation remains my top pick. It’s surprising there hasn’t been a Hollywood remake yet - rumors pop up now and then, but nothing has materialized. \n\nThe movie tells the story of a brilliant math teacher who becomes embroiled in a crime, devising a meticulous plan to outsmart the police and protect someone dear to him. But his strategy is put to the test when his equally brilliant former college friend joins the investigation. What unfolds is a tense and layered game of wits, combining mystery and thriller elements with emotional depth. Rather than sticking to a standard police procedural, the movie impressively delves deeply into the psychological motives of each of the key characters.\n\nThe film is based on the celebrated Japanese mystery novel by Keigo Higashino, and for movie fans, this is an absolute must-watch. I can’t recommend it highly enough.\n\n**SPOILERS BELOW!**\n\nWhere do I even begin? What I love most about this film is how it pits two brilliant characters against each other in a battle of wits. Both are highly intelligent, methodical, and driven by complex, often conflicting motives, making for a suspenseful, balanced showdown.\n\nAnother standout aspect is the intricate, multi-layered cover-up of a killing devised by the math teacher. Driven by his quiet adoration, he goes to extraordinary lengths to protect the woman he loves. Every move he makes is calculated, drawing viewers down a twisting path filled with subtle, fascinating clues. His friend is equally sharp, intuitively deciphering what the math teacher may be hiding. Watching these two intellectual giants navigate the high-stakes scenario is exhilarating.\n\nThe performances bring solid depth to the story. The math teacher’s portrayal captures a powerful vulnerability, making his brilliance and desperation feel deeply human and relatable. You feel for him even though he has killed an innocent person to protect the woman he loves. The woman he protects plays her role with quiet strength and guilt, while the college friend brings a cool, precise determination to uncover the truth, haunted by the realization that his old friend - perhaps even cleverer than he - is his opponent.\n\nUltimately, for me, this movie is more than a well-crafted mystery. It’s a heartfelt narrative of sacrifice, loneliness, and unrequited love. You can’t help but feel for the math teacher, who’s willing to sacrifice everything - even to the point of implicating himself and taking an innocent life - to shield her. This wasn’t a movie where I was just waiting for the final reveal. I was so invested in the characters that I genuinely hoped the ending would do justice to them all.",

        "selftext": "*Strange Darling* has gotten a lot of praise in this sub, and I see what people like about it, but it also rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nI’m sure you could write a dissertation about the problematic gender politics at play, but my issues are more with the story itself and the way that it’s presented.\n\nI think that announcing your film was shot on 35mm in big text right at the start is eye roll-inducing on its own, but this weird moment is also kind of indicative of the movie’s whole vibe, which is like it’s constantly asking, “Aren’t I so cool and interesting?”\n\nThere’s a very self-conscious quality to the non-linear structure. The movie is presented in chapters and we’re given the numbers out of sequence, so it’s clear right away that the film *really* wants us to know that it’s doing something weird. Most viewers will recognize right away that the movie is hinting at some big twist that will turn our perception of what we’ve seen on its head. The problem is, that twist is painfully obvious.\n\nThe reveal that the Lady is actually the serial killer that the opening text crawl tells us about feels so predictable that I was certain there must be another twist coming. Okay, so she’s the killer, sure, but who is the guy? Is he really a cop? Is he undercover? Is he also a serial killer and these two just picked each other as targets?\n\nNope, none of that. Once we learn the twist, that’s kind of it. The rest of the movie is mostly just her pulling the same trick over and over (“I’m injured, help me”) and it basically working every time. The film’s final act is shockingly conventional.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the movie because it has a great soundtrack and Willa Fitzgerald is fantastic, but I don’t think it’s nearly as clever as it thinks it is.

        "selftext": "So tonight, I had the pleasure of watching a double feature at my local library tonight for Halloween Eve. Those two movies were Body Bags, by John Carpenter, and The Monster Squad, AKA The Goonies vs. The Universal Monsters.\n\nThe first film, Body Bags, was pretty good and fun. It was sort of an anthology film created by John Carpenter, that was originally supposed to be a show on Showtime, but then Showtime dropped it and it got reworked with whatever they had done into a movie. \n\nThe three stories were one about a slasher at a gas station at night, hunting the new employee there, a story about a man trying to get hair only for it to backfire and him getting infected by an alien Parasite, and the final one has a baseball player (played by Marl Hamill) lose his eye in a car accident, and ends up getting the eye of a serial killer, and ends up going crazy. The film was honestly fine for what it was.\n\nBut The Monster Squad.....the Monster Squad was so good. This is probably the best use of the Universal Monsters I have seen and probably the closest we will see to seeing them all on screen at once, and the best part is, it did not take itself too seriously at all in the slightest. The costume work for the Monsters was phenomenal, and the acting from the kids was genuinely not bad at all either. \n\nThe story was appropriately ridiculous and insane in the best way possible, with a lot of corny and cheesy moments to come. Don't even get me started on the Pepsi product placement. The film however did have some unironically good stuff as well, such as humor that unironically landed, genuinely good heartfelt moments, great costume work (like I said), and a solidly paced runtime of an hour and 22 minutes.\n\nThe is truly the Avengers of the Universal Monsters, and I absolutely love it. If they ever remake this, instead of being dark, realistic, and gritty, I hope its just as fun and over the top as the original is.",

David Carradine was so good you just didn’t want to see him go. I always wondered if he’d end up being alive in the long-awaited sequel, but Carradine’s passing removed that possibility, sadly. (I know that him being alive wasn’t a really possibility with Pei-Mai’s Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, but I was hoping for something.) \n\nDon’t even get me started on the deaths of Newt and Hicks in *Alien3*. I pretend that movie doesn’t exist, it was so angering for me. Here these two plucky souls survived a harrowing attack and close calls with drones and face huggers only to get killed in a crash. In Newt’s case, it was even worse because she watched her entire colony get wiped out, then the crew of Marines sent to save her get demolished (“Game over, man!”), and then she dies while in stasis. This little girl survived so many odds only to end like that, and we got really invested in the bond between Newt and Ripley and Hicks and Ripley only for it to go away. ",

Oh, sure, we still get some campy moments like Close being called a bitch by a witness or Close freaking out in the closet over a contrived, silly twist. \n\nAnd Robert Loggia is a total odd duck, acting like a supporting character from a Columbo episode. \n\nAnd knowing Lucie Arnaz, Lucille Ball's daughter, was a potential contender for the part as well as Jane Fonda who ended up in the campfest of drunk old starlet finds herself with a dead body in her bed in \"The Morning After\", makes it funnier.",

When it comes to designing for film, stage, and television, how much of a line is there between \"costumes\" (as in something that is intentionally made for a performance and not much else) - and \"clothing\" (something this is also made for a performance but could be worn as an actual garment away from the spotlight)? \n\nPutting aside the question of whether or not it's strange to wear period dress or fantastical items as everyday garments, I think at least part of it boils down to the level of crafting that goes into them. Something made of relatively cheap material without much detailing - and possibly mass produced - falls more onto the \"costume\" side of the scale. By contrast, when extreme attention is given to the look, feel, and fit of a garment (not necessarily going full haute couture but with a similar mindset), that seem to me more like a \"clothing\" item.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on where you think this divide falls (or whether you think it's even real) as well as your listings of films, stage productions, and television shows that lean towards one side or the other.",

Laid To Rest). don't count)\n\n---\n\n* Halloween\n* Friday The 13th\n* A Nightmare On Elm Street\n* Saw\n* Scream\n* Child's Play\n* The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n* Evil Dead\n* Hellraiser\n* Phantasm\n* Alien\n* Predator\n* Final Destination\n* The Purge\n* Insidious\n* Paranormal Activity\n* Conjuring Universe\n* Terrifier\n* A Quiet Place\n\n---\n\nIMO, the best entry in each series:\n\n* Halloween - 1978 Original\n* Friday The 13th - Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter\n* A Nightmare On Elm Street - New Nightmare\n* Saw - Original\n* Scream - Original\n* Child's Play - Original\n* The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - 2003 Remake\n* Evil Dead - Evil Dead II\n* Hellraiser - Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth\n* Phantasm - Phantasm II\n* Alien - Aliens\n* Predator - Predator 2\n* Final Destination - Original\n* The Purge - The Purge: Anarchy\n* Insidious - Insidious: Chapter 3\n* Paranormal Activity - Original\n* Conjuring Universe - The Conjuring 2\n* Terrifier - Terrifier 2\n* A Quiet Place - Maybe the original? I enjoyed all three and have a hard time picking a favorite.\n\n\nAlso some additional ones:\n\n\n* Jaws - Original\n* Jurassic Park - Original\n* MonsterVerse - Maybe Godzilla Vs. Kong? I have a very hard time picking a favorite from this series as I love them all.\n* It - Chapter One (2017)\n* Tremors - Original\n* Candyman - 1992 Original\n* Hannibal Lecter - The Silence Of The Lambs\n* Romero's Living Dead - Day Of The Dead (1985)\n* Return Of The Living Dead - Return Of The Living Dead Part II\n* Puppet Master - Puppet Master 4\n* Pumpkinhead - Original\n* Wishmaster - Original\n* Maniac Cop - Maniac Cop 2\n* Leprechaun - Original\n* Warlock - Original\n* Critters - Original\n* Cube - Original\n* Poltergeist - Poltergeist II: The Other Side\n* I Know What You Did Last Summer - Original\n* Re-Animator - Original\n* Hatchet - Hatchet II\n\n---\n\nI'm sure I left some off. I just listed the major series I remember for the time being. I'm sure a few of my choices are controversial or unconventional. Not to say I dislike the likes of the original Poltergeist or TCM or ROTLD, I just simply enjoyed the sequels or remakes more (and bear in mind, I pretty much consider the likes of Predator 2, ROTLD2 and Poltergeist II equal with the originals as is). I find the original TCM and remake are actually pretty close for me as well. Some might argue Jurassic Park isn't really Horror but I've always kind of considered the series a bit of a Natural Horror/Sci-Fi hybrid, figured why not have it in with my additional choices.\n\nWith The Conjuring Universe, the Annabelle films along with The Nun and Curse Of La Llarona count as well. With Terrifier film, there's not just the Terrifier trilogy but also All Hallows'\nEve from 2013 which featured Art The Clown in a pre-Terrifier appearance.",

The clear winner was ***Иди и смотри*** or in english: *Come and See* \\- an anti-war film that I've never seen before and which doesn't necessarily sound like light entertainment. But now it's on my watch list and I would like to thank everyone who took part in this little ‘game’ yesterday.\n\nToday I continue directly with the next European country in my alphabetical list: **Belgium**. Somehow I have the feeling that I could predict the winner today, but hey - there have already been one or two surprises here (such as ‘The Sound of Music’ not winning for Austria) and that's exactly what I love - so please feel free to suggest films that not everyone has on their radar. \n\nThe only thing I would ask you to do is to keep it to the following two rules:\n\n* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.\n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to only name one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n\n\n>Day 6: Belarus - Иди и смотри (engl.: Come and See)\n\n>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.

        "selftext": "The idea of reliving the same day with no way out is a psychologically damaging experience in itself that I cannot even imagine how Phil was able to keep sane through it all, unless deep down he was actually a good man, I think that's the only way this movie didn't turn out to be a horror movie. Imagine someone like Anton Chigurh, or Patrick Bateman or even the joker (lord almighty the horror) or even Jack Torrance or that guy from A clockwork orange I don't even think these guys would ever want to leave. I get that it's not meant to be a psychological thriller horror experience but it could just have easily been if Phil saw life differently.\nThink about it, he basically started out as a narcissistic asshole but became a completely changed man by the end of it. Because deep down i believe he was always a redeemable person.\n\nHowever, how he was able to come out of that loop a psychologically stable person with no issues is beyond me. Just by the fact that he knew how to play the piano on an expert level, became an expert ice sculptor, he knew everything about everyone down to the intimate level. In order to be proficient in the skills shown he would have needed at least a decade each to master each skill individually and decades more to be proficient in them. I'm going to guess here and say he spent at least a thousand years in that loop. I mean at some point he tried taking his own life unsuccessfully, which means he was pushed to the most extremes of trauma. I just cannot imagine the horror, I don't think hell could be worse than that. At some point every human interaction to him would feel like a script. No matter how much you love a movie, if you have to watch it everyday for a thousand years or so, you will grow to hate it. There could be some sort of nihilistic undertones here. I understand that the movie uses the loop as a path towards self improvement which really softens the horrific vibe of the film, but if Phil never chose that path, it could have easily been one of the most nightmarish, dark twisted terrifying exploration on isolation and futility. I'm honestly surprised there aren't more films exploring this angle.",

Granted I may get absolute torn up in this discussion. Please be gentle. If you have not yet seen this movie then this is not a discussion for you. \n    \nIt’s been about a hour after I watched it and my mind is still kinda buzzing. Because I think the movie is about sincerity and our fear of it.  Please bear with me.  \n \n What do we mean when we talk about love?\n\nKeaton starting off the movie levitating  is such a delicious opening shot.  You are in a surreal experience and informed of that right at the start.  Reality is always in question.\n\nThen the meta layers in this movie are so thick.  Keaton is of course the former Batman/Birdman.  So your mind already connects that. Norton is famous for being a real life pain in the ass. So your mind steps back a second time at that. The uncut camera trick makes you aware a third time that you are seeing movie magic and yet more unreality.  \n\nIt feels to me as though it is setting up this hyper complex meta mystery box and yet at key moments it returns to the play. The choice of Carver representing a straight and real story that is credible.\n\nThe feeling overall for me becomes this. The movie is an attack on meta commentary. It’s an attack on mystery box style movies that have mind blowing twists. Of course it does this by presenting its own twists and turns of unreality.\n\nBut in the end I guess what I’m getting out of it is that we can no longer handle a straight story. We have to have our minds blown by shocking twists and turns. We need to insulate ourselves from the story and emotion by having a puzzle to solve.\n\nAnd we are presented with the last puzzle to solve as we have romantic crescendo music rising and falling and sharply cutting off.  False endings and dramatic twists and turns.\n\nWe can not handle a simple Carver story anymore.  We need absurd plot twists to insulate ourselves from sincere emotion.  We need to be removed from direct emotion.  \n\nAll of my friends are super annoyed because whenever I watch this movie I talk about it and everyone is super bored of hearing me speculate.  I hope this rambling made some sense.  Maybe I’m completely wrong in how I’m viewing it.  Maybe I’m doing a poor job of interpreting it.  \n\nTear me up.  ",

        "selftext": "I rewatched this great movie recently.  I have always been a fan of the genre..and I mean this in a purist sense.  The theme of the conflict of westward expansion of civilization vs. the idea of lost individualism.  Is the civilization of the wild worth the loss the mythical exceptional individual?  Shane explains this theme better than any other western and I think you see start to see more exploration and revisionism afterwards like great The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance that explores this theme even further.   This brings me to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  The first that really brings this movie into the modern era and fantastic revisionist for the theme.  It's reflective, humanizing, intense and beautiful from the first black and white silent reel to the final freeze-frame.  It's held up easily as one of the best movies Ive watched all time but I think some of that comes from the context of knowing where the movie is coming from and the themes it so intelligently explores.  But even as I watched this as a kid before I actually watched the other movies I listed, it was incredible.  The chemistry between the two leads is unmatched.\n\nI think I just wanted to highly recommend it again today (along with the other movies I mentioned).  There is a sadness to it now as back even into the 70s there was still a strong ideal of individual exceptionalism and self reliance running in America that older people might remember that has been gone for decades now.  Butch Cassidy is in many ways the epitaph for that ideal that has in many ways been replaced now with superhero movies and sci fi that mythologizes the individual with godlike beings.  Granted I am a huge fan of these movies as well but they lack the internal conflicting question these westerns had.  Shane says yes.  The sacrifice is worth it.  There can be no more guns in the valley.  Liberty Valance makes you question it.  Is the sacrifice of the Tom Donaphins, who have held the picket line worth the life of the inevitable civilizing Ransom Stoddarts? I think Butch Cassidy finally looks back and says poignantly \"no\".  What has been lost was a kind of freedom and humanity that has not been adequately replaced by railroads.  \n\nI rarely see this movie mentioned these days.  All of these movies are among the best and thoughtful American cinema has ever produced.  When discussing westerns today, people mention the Good the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven, Tombstone etc.  All excellent movies but they are excellent movies set in the western period.  They (especially movies like Unforgiven, the Outlaw Josey Wales, etc.) explore their own complex themes but, specifically, discussing westerns they are not a discussion on the disappearing idea of individualism in America that was happening in the 50s-70s.  I wonder if the modern audience can relate to this or understand the loss or the complex internal ambivalence about what was sacrificed and what was gained.",

However, John Landis didn’t want him as he didn’t want the film to be a SNL film, sho he persuading Chevy to star in Foul Play instead)\n\n**1980:** **American Gigolo** (Role: Julian Kaye) (Actor who got it: Richard Gere) (Reason: Chevy was offered the role, but he turned it down)\n\n**1981:** **Arthur** (Role: Arthur Bach) (Actor who got it: Dudley More) (Reason: Chevy was considered for the role)\n\n**1981:** **Raiders of the Lost Ark** (Role: Indiana Jones) (Actor who got it: Harrison Ford) (Reason: Chevy was considered for the role)\n\n**1984:** **Splash** (Role: Allen Bauer) (Actor who got it: Tom Hanks) (Reason: Chevy was offered the role, but he turned it down)\n\n**1984:** **Ghostbusters** (Role: Peter Venkman) (Actor who got it: Bill Murray) (Reason: He turned the role. According to Chase, the finished film is nothing like the script that he read, adding that the script was much scarier than the film.)\n\n**1987:** **Fatal Attraction** (Role: Dan Gallagher) (Actor who got it: Michael Douglas) (Reason: Chevy was offered the role, but he turned it down)\n\n**1988:** **Who Framed Roger Rabbit** (Role: Eddie Valinet) (Actor who got it: Bob Hoskins) (Reason: Chevy Chase was the 2nd choice for the role, but he turned down the role as he wasn’t interested in the role)\n\n**1989:** **Turner & Hooch** (Role: Scott Turner) (Actor who got it: Tom Hanks) (Reason: Chevy was considered and was offered the role but he turned it down)\n\n**1989:** **The Fabulous Baker Boy**s (Role: Either Jack or Frank Baker) (Actor who got it: Jeff Bridges & Beau Bridges) (Reason: When the film first came to development, 20th Century Fix originally wanted Chevy & Bill Murray for either role in the film)\n\n**1991:** **My Girl** (Role: Harry Sultenfuss) (Actor who got it: Dan Aykroyd) (Reason: Chevy was considered for the role, but didn’t get the role as he was know only for comedies at the time and not for dramas, so the role was given to Dan Aykroyd)\n\n**1992:** **The Player** (Role: Griffin Mill) (Actor who got it: Tim Robbins) (Reason: Chevy was in fact very much interested in the role and wanted the part, but Warner Bros didn’t want him for the role)\n\n**1992:** **The Mighty Ducks** (Role: Gordon Bombay) (Actor who got it: Emilio Estevez) (Reason: Chevy was offered the role, but he turned it down)\n\n**1993:** **So I Married An Ax Murderer** (Role: Charlie/Stuart McKenzie) (Actor who got it: Mike Myers) (Reason: Chevy was the original choice for the role, but apparently didn’t like the character)\n\n**1994:** **Forrest Gump** (Role: Forrest Gump) (Actor who got it: Tom Hanks) (Reason: Chevy was offered the lead role, but he turned it down as he felt the script wasn’t good enough. He later claimed that Tom Hanks tweaked the script)\n\n**1994:** **The Santa Clause** (Role: Scott Calvin) (Actor who got it: Tim Allen) (Reason: Chevy was offered the role, but he had to turned it down due to scheduling conflicts)\n\n**1995: Toy Story** (Role: Buzz Lightyear) (Actor who got it: Tim Allen) (Reason: Turned down the role because his agent advised him against doing the project. He didn’t want to turned it down, but went with his agent’s advice)\n\n**1999:** **American Beauty** (Role: Lester Burham) (Actor who got it: Kevin Spacey) (Reason: Chevy was the 1st choice for the lead, but he turned it down as he didn’t like the content and out of fear that it would hurt his family-friendly image)\n\n**2007:** **Alvin & The Chipmunks** (Role: Dave Seville) (Actor who got it: Jason Lee) (Reason: At some point during development, Chevy was considered for the role)\n\nUltimately, I think Chevy Chase is a good actor, but I think he was his own worst enemy and really had lost potential. He really could have had bigger success but from everywhere I read about the guy, he had a really massive ego and was very difficult to work. I feel it’s a shame, I think Chevy could of done more things, and really could of ventured into drama.\n\nOverall, What are your thoughts on this? What roles do you wish Chevy Chase accepted?",

I don't want to rehash those discussions.\n\nI want to talk about the genre/motif/feel of the movie. I feel like it can't decide what it wants to be. It's trying to be Arrival, Terminator, and Aliens at the same time, and those three things are fighting each other. There are bits of the movie that are using sci-fi tropes to explore poinient emotional family dynamics (like Arrival), while other parts of the movie lean into the trippy time travel mystery thriller thing (like Terminator), but then big chunks of the film are just balls out action packed soldiers vs alien monsters sequences - complete with a \"queen\" alien that's bigger, smarter, and harder to kill than the rest (like Aliens). All of these different styles kind of clash with each other throughout the movie and feel disjointed. It could have worked as any one of these genres, they just needed to pick one and stick with it.\n\nCurious what others think about the film making (not the plot or the premise or the time travel mechanics) of this movie\n\nETA: I do want to give it credit for not being a sequel, prequel, reboot, spin-off, or adaptation. It was its own thing and that is getting rarer and rarer, especially in high budget sci-fi action. ",

I decided I wanted to make 2025 the year I tackled a lot of movies I hadn't seen yet, and there are so many out there that I could watch that i've begun to get Choice paralysis haha!\n\n  \nWhen it comes to recommending for me; I come with a unique advantage/disadvantage; I have seen very few movies. Maybe 30 in my lifetime, outside of the basic Marvel movies and things I watched when I was a kid. As an adult, [These are the movies I recall that I've watched](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Vwh4qW7gLSxdxD1xNVXkvuOFBfs_rV_AeIfdHM3zsQ/edit?usp=sharing). I really enjoy watching movies, but Typically I'd prefer to play a video game. Next year though, I want to flip that, and watch a bunch of movies in my spare time.\n\n  \nIn addition to the link featuring my seen-movie history, here's a brief summary of some of the things i enjoy.\n\n* Scorcese is absolutely my favourite director, as Casino is my favourite movie ever with Goodfellas as a close second.\n* I can sometimes enjoy a good football movie, as I'm a football fan. Movies i've seen include The Program and Any Given Sunday.\n* In terms of the major series i've watched in my adult years, I've seen LOTR and Star Wars.\n* I've recently gotten into the Horror genre, and my favourite movie I've watched this year was Longlegs. \n* I really enjoy movies with twist endings, like >!Usual Suspects, The Village, and Sixth Sense.!< \n* I can enjoy a good comedy movie as well, with movies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun being some personal Favourites.\n* I also love animation, so movies like A Silent Voice are also welcome! I currently have some Studio Ghibli stuff on my hitlist that will likely get added to the list of movies, but i'd still love any recommendations for some good animated movies.\n* Additionally, I have access to free movies at the cinemas, so if there is a movie that is coming out that you think would fit this list, please let me know! I don't really keep up with new releases anymore so i'd love to know if they're something coming down the pipe I may enjoy!\n\nI already also have a watchlist that includes movies like Spirited Away, The Thing, Joker, some classic horror movies like Nightmare On Elm St. and Friday the 13th, Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight and Terminator 2. \n\n\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for my weekly movies for 2025, I'd love to hear them! I'm currently filling out a schedule of movies, and when it's done i'll be happy to share! I'm looking forward to beginning this journey with you all, and I hope this will allow me to enjoy movies more than ever before!",

Here's the gist I remember\n\nIn this film, the protagonist is approached and asked to do something by a man to aid the war effort agains the enemy.  But along the way the man discovers that he's really aiding the enemy and then has to escape to the enemy country, only to discover that the conflict has been fabricated. The ending features a significant twist where they learn the truth from a contact, revealing that the supposed enemy has been defeated, and the ongoing facade of the war is maintained for control but the 'enemy' has been defeated. And the guy that reached out to the protagonist is really working for the government and pulling the strings.\n\nThe ending is basically where the protagonist and his female partner are left in the defeated country and the bad guy flies off back to the original country.\n\nIt's driving me nuts. The bad guy essentially has a story about how they defeated the enemy years ago but keep the war going to maintain control. It was a mind trip for me...as kid.",

        "selftext": "Recently, while watching season three of The Bear, I noticed how bad Carmy is at expressing his feelings. With the exception of that remarkable speech at the support group, most of his lines are made up of awkward, stilted dialogue and angry outbursts. The scenes with his late brother Michael reinforce this, because he comes off as eloquent and gregarious while Carmy is a perfectionist loner.   \n\nThis type of character makes The Bear a perfect example of “show, don’t tell.” We discover his story mostly through flashbacks, small details and the reactions of the ensemble cast.    \n\nAnyhow this train of thought got me into thinking about films with the same kind of focus. How many movies can you think of where the main character is unable, or unwilling to explain themselves for the sake of the plot? Or this could be simply a character that gets few lines on the screen. I think movies with that kind of constraint would have to have a solid, compelling story to work.",

Probably, but then that would imply he understood what 'Un Oeuf' out of context means.\n\nSo it's either something genuinely widespread and understood in that 'establishment' culture or he did not understand what JS was referring to or even meant, and JGL just wanted to placate him.\n\nBoth of those options sound fairly reasonable. **However.**\n\nIf it's the former, can you imagine all of that old-school, prejudiced, all-powerful, and in control, establishment telling each other this joke about an egg - 'Un Oeuf' in French..\n\nIt's a wild concept.\n\nOr, again, he did not understand. Which might be fair enough.\n\nBut then imagine his perspective - some oddball, heartbroken, slightly pathetic (in the classical sense), but nonetheless very human, courageous, and deeply empathetic guy you're prosecuting suddenly asks about *an* *egg.*\n\nIn French.\n\nPronounced in yet another slightly weird, but very committed, manner by JS.\n\nAnd he does not ask any questions - he just accepts what he has been told.\n\n**Yup.**\n\n***Why?***",

He called 911, stuttered something about a stabbing before the bad guy got a hold of his phone and hung up. \nThe bad guy then instantly called 911 again to tell them some lies so no police would show up. \n\nOr that's what I thought would happen! \nInstead he did in fact confirm that there was a stabbing and he just lost connection. They then paid some club members to stage an actual non-fatal stab wound (with a knife length just below of what would get them in real trouble), so they have a convincing story to tell the police. \nAnd it makes so much sense! Every other excuse he could have come up with would only have made the cops more suspicious and send someone over anyways. \n\nTo me that was just a stroke of genius in term of writing and subverting expectations. \n\nSimilarly I loved how the girl later COMPLETELY missed the shot at that dog sprinting at here. Because OF COURSE she would not hit in a stress situation like that with no gun experience\nIt's just a minor thing but unexpectedly realistic scenes like that made an already pretty good movie great. \n\nAny other movies/scenes that made you say \"now THAT'S just good writing!\"?

        "title": "Is Psycho a prime example of a movie of it’s time ?",
        "selftext": "So in the spirit of Halloween I watched Psycho for the first time ever this week. \n\nI will start by saying it’s a great film. I do not think it’s bad or am looking to trash it. My point here is for how renowned it is, and how it is atop a lot of people’s  horror films and even fave films in general lists, I definitely left feeling like it is somewhat overrated. \n\nThe acting and cinematography I felt was top notch for the most part. (I especially loved the shots that included the taxidermy birds. )\n\nI had obviously seen the iconic shower scene but i knew nothing else about the film, especially the ending. \n\n\nMy main gripes with the film are as followed:\n\n1. Maybe the most common take of a lot of viewers taking this sort of position, but the film leans thriller/suspense vs ‘scary’. Horror filmmaking evolved so much, and I know this film inspired so many horror films since, but I don’t think I can say I felt “scared” at many points except 1 or 2. But I can def see it being scary for people in 1960. \n\n2. This is probably my biggest gripe but I didn’t find the twist to be all that shocking , like at all. Again , idk if it’s because I have seen a lot of movies at this point but the ending became quite obvious for 2 reasons. 1) you never see Norman and his mother in the same scene together (besides him carrying her down the stairs) . While it adds mystery , it is also obvious that Hitchcock is hiding something here. 2) the film is literally called Psycho, lol. To me, that meant there is going to be some ‘psychotic’ reveal at some point. And once the sheriff explains the mother died years ago, “Norman being a schizophrenic”  was a pretty immediate thought for me. I will say, the reveal of him in the garb was probably the scariest part of the film, but it literally lasts 10 seconds and the acting of him being subdued is pretty horrible and borderline comical, to a point where it kinda ruined the reveal for me. \n\n3. The debated scene of the psychiatrist explaining to everyone in the most literal sense what we all just watched. I am not sure if this was a more common device in filmmaking back then, but it definitely felt like “oh this scene is for people who have no understanding of what happened”. It was another scene that kinda took me out of the experience. \n\nThere are other small plot devices I felt were very stupid unless I missed something  (i.e how is Norman just leaving Cabin 1 unlocked after the murder ???)\n\nSo overall, it is a great film but seems like it is more renowned for what it did at the time vs really holding up in certain critical ways. While they were made later I feel like The Excorcist or Rosemary’s Baby are much better ‘horror’ films. \n\n",

The movie also reminds of “The X Files”\nEpisode “Humbug” about a conjoined twin that extracts itself from his brother and goes on a killing spree. This film is similar in concept only the “twin” involved here causes more psychological harm and uses its sibling’s body as a puppet.\n\nIt’s a film I think it slept on.\n\nWhat are some other unique horror villains I should know about as someone who isn’t a huge horror film buff? \n\nAlso what do you think of “Malignant” from 2021?

[Amber Alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aCr7-oJ0JQ) is a thriller with Hayden Panatierre and Tyler James Williams and [Take Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boeiStdXJuE) is an action movie with Scott Adkins. \n\nHow do these films make all their money back? Is video on demand enough? Do they still pre-sell films and get their budget for the movie from different investors based on who's starring in it? It can't be for territories anymore as video on demand is almost worldwide and Netflix and Amazon Prime Video want to buy worldwide rights to movies. I think even studios like Lionsgate and Universal want to buy movies to add them to their catalogue and release them as Home Premieres. \n\nIf a producer makes a $10 million horror or thriller, would they sell the movie directly to a subscription streamer or pay-TV channel (branding as an \"X\" original) for a one or two stage payment? Or video on demand alongside licensing it to pay-TV movie channels then movie packages to general cable and network TV?",

I have no idea what he's talking about in his Anora review. It feels super bizarre and nit-picky. He likes the movie but criticizes Baker for just being a director? And says he's acting more like a producer with Anora? To me, for instance, this is a slightly absurd criticism that you can level against most movies:\n\n\"But the talk always fits into the plot like cogs in a machine. Baker has a finely tuned story sense—the machine runs efficiently, and the characters are essentially workers enlisted to keep it running. Their emotional lives don’t factor into the movie except to the extent that they serve the cause; there’s no side chatter, no offhand conversation, and they don’t break the framework of their function to delve deep into experiences, memories, ambitions, dreams, and ideas.\"\n\nAnd even weirder is this remark:\n\n\"The characters move within even the grittiest spaces as if walking past backdrops or C.G.I. green screens. What’s missing from “Anora” isn’t the characters’ physical contact with locations but their mental contact. Baker never lets them express what they know or think about the places they inhabit.\"\n\nWhich I had ZERO sense watching the movie. I'm not even sure how you would want Baker to write that in.\n\nSomeone please parse.\n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/anora-is-more-for-show-than-for-substance](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/anora-is-more-for-show-than-for-substance)\n\nUpdate: \nAnora does have its shortcomings, but I don’t think it’s fair nor helpful to criticize a director for rigorously carrying out his vision, which Brody contends is Baker’s flaw (I.e. “overbearingly self produced”). Granted I’m not expert but that seems quite tricky to delineate. I see that being a strength in other contexts. Imhp Brody’s criticisms read more like frustrations with the practicalities of getting a film like this done in this day and age. ",

        "title": "I think I figured out the target in Top Gun Maverick",
        "selftext": "First the obvious disclaimer: in the spirit of \"TG:M is a Greatest Hits album\", the target for The Mission is conspicuously un-named, much as in the original. It is *intended* to be un-knowable: it's not actually important to the story, it's better to sell the movie internationally, and it's a fun easter egg. The enemy airfield coordinates (briefly on screen) [even point to Point Nemo](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/x480j3/in_top_gun_maverick_2022_the_coordinates_for_the/), the spot in the middle of the ocean farthest from any land on earth.\n\nALL THAT SAID, I say it's \"intended\" to be unknown, but there's enough detail to figure it out anyway. Others have tried before, but with [all deference to the fine folks at The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2022/6/3/23151745/top-gun-maverick-enemy-country) (a site I love), I think their conclusions are wrong.\n\nThe start of this rabbit-hole comes from the MacGuffin mission briefing speech (MacMission? MacGuffion?) that Warlock delivers when Maverick first arrives back ~~in purgatory~~ at North Island. As the fella says (emphasis mine):\n\n>Warlock: Theee target... is an unsanctioned uranium plant built in violation of a **multilateral NATO TREATY**\n\nAnd there it is. I'd watched this a dozen times before that hit my ears. It's a *NATO* treaty. Not a UN resolution, not a multinational agreement, a NATO treaty. **ETA: This is why it's not Iran (per The Ringer's logic above) - Iran is not a signatory to NATO treaties.**\n\nWhy does this matter? To violate a treaty, you have to be a *signatory* to that treaty. And if it's a NATO treaty, the signatories are **NATO members** ([ETA: this guy agrees](https://opiniojuris.org/2022/10/26/top-gun-maverick-international-law-empire-and-nostalgia/)). And just like that, we've narrowed down the list of potential targets from >200 to 30 in 2022. Let's get to work.\n\nFirst to get a small detail out of the way: I am not an expert (nor even an amateur) in international military politics. Article 5 of the NATO charter provides for unified military action against attacks on any individual member. This doesn't seem to **explicitly** outlaw military action by one member (here: the US) against another - for the silliness of this thought experiment, we can accept the \"rogue state control\" to mean that there is a breakaway region in a member state, and the others have agreed to take action against it (with the accession of the non-rogue part of that country). It's a stretch, but not an impossibility.\n\nThe movie gives us 3 key pieces to start whittling the list:\n\n1. The target 's geography\n   1. Is on the ocean\n   2. Has mountains directly next to the coast\n   3. Is accessible from the ocean by aircraft carrier\n   4. Has meaningful snow-cover in the winter at the foot of those mountains\n      * Don't get confused by Dog Fight Football - San Diego has tarps-off beach weather year-round\n2. The target has sufficient political instability to facilitate a \"rogue state\"/breakaway region\n3. The target has *credible* access to a \"5th gen fighter\" - while it isn't named, it's not a US plane, and the NATO theater means this basically HAS to be the Su-57 Felon\n\nLet's start knocking them down\n\n* 0. We know it's not the US, 29 left\n* 1.1 eliminates 5 landlocked members (Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, North Macedonia, Luxembourg), 24 left\n* 1.2 eliminates 12 flat-coast countries (the 3 Baltics, Poland, Germany, Denmark Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania), 12 left\n* 1.3 eliminates 1 (Bulgaria) - no carriers in the Black Sea, 11 left\n* 1.4 eliminates 1 (Greece) barring really weird weather - 10 left\n* 2. is cuts out all 7 [very stable countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PV.PER.RNK) (Iceland, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Canada), 3 left\n\nThat leaves us with access to the Felon and 3 countries: Albania, Montenegro, and Turkey. There is a small amount of judgement here, but I think we have enough to make the call: Russia isn't realistically giving it's \"definitely real and not a model\" prize aircraft to anyone, but they're especially not giving it to a country that they can only get to by going through other NATO countries. This, coupled with the *relatively* higher level of political stability in Albania and Montenegro lead us to 1 inevitable conclusion:\n\n**Tom Cruise, the actor, personally dropped bombs on Turkiye**",

        "selftext": "One of my favorite movies from Robert Zemeckis is \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\". It's a small movie about a group of fans chasing after the Beatles who are coming to America to show up at the Ed Sullivan Show. \n\nIt was funny, engaging and unpredictable and many of the actors in the movie ended up being in Zemeckis' more popular movies. \n\nBut as mainstream as his movies got, they also became formulaic and sentimental and unsurprising. \n\nZemeckis did experiment by exploring other avenues, like CGI animation or having live action interact with animation, but when it comes to story, his movies couldn't be more square, more run of the mill. \n\nHe made movies for the masses, sheer entertainment, and there's nothing wrong with that, but there's nothing wrong in going small, in challenging oneself as a writer.",

        "selftext": "Video: https://youtu.be/nKaT8ZKgdu8?si=DHC9-QTyvLnbTy6w\n\nSkip to 2:45 For review\n\nBelow is the written script that was altered and changed when delivered in the video. Some on the grammar may be wonky so forgive me.\n \nReview: \n\nSo this was interesting. I’ll start by saying that going into this film, the extent of knowledge I had on Sam Raimi’ filmography began and ended with his marvel movies. Now his Spider-Man Trilogy is a favorite of mine, which is something I’m sure I’ll express in a future video, and I even appreciated his Doctor Strange Film for what it was. The horror elements he brings in his camerawork and directing is really impressive even if Disnified. Something I always appreciate about Raimis filmmaking is his movement with the camera and his directing style as a whole. The Spider-Man films set a precedent for superhero films and a lot of that is credit to Raimi, but before I let that tangent grow more than it should, my point being is I have yet to truly experience ‘Sam Raimi, the Horror director’. Now before the horror community crucifies me in the comments, I do think it's important to note that I’m waiting for Evil Dead to be selected in Horror Roulette, so I can give the most genuine reaction at the time. \nBut what did I think of this PG-13 Horror flick? UHHHHHHH it’s um. Yanno there’s a lot to like about it. As previously mentioned, my biggest focus going in was this film as an inclusion in Raimi’s filmography. And with that I have to say he does continue to impress. I felt the biggest highlights was how Sam shot the horror sequences in particular. His camera movements and blocking in this film does a great job when building suspense and genuine terror at moments, or at least the direct threat of evil. There’s sequences like Christine being cursed in the parking garage by MrsGanush that I feel has genuinely great scares through the use of shadows and blocking and other super fun film buzzwords I’ll use to convince you I know what I'm talking about :) Or  later during the curse when Christine has a vision of Mrs. Ganush appearing in her bed, really really creepy sequences, super effectively shot. Now to stay on the path of positive for just a bit, I also just think the overall premise of the film begins really strong. You have your main protagonist, a businesswoman trying to earn the respect of her boss, and by doing this is now the victim of some ancient gypsy curse. Pretty fucking rad if you ask me. \nNow… my tone is certainly gonna switch just a little but stay with me. I really enjoyed the film for about the first 1.5-2 acts. I think it starts strong with the ideas it brings and the horror begins being really effective, but then the ending kinda gets to the levels of bat-shit. And that’s fine, I mean I enjoy Halloween 6 from time to time, but I much more enjoyed the set up than the pay off for this one. I also think it’s important to note that this film has a ton of camp which is staple for Raimi to my understanding. This wasn’t an issue for me and I don’t want to credit that to the bat shitery I mentioned. No, the aspects of the film that I particularly found silly was just how the stakes in this film increase exponentially throughout the film, and the scares grow more and more out there with some of them being effective while others were not really. The majority of the horror sequences I didn’t enjoy in this, I can point to one particular reason as to why and thats the CGI. I try not to be the guy that complains about poor CGI but when you have sequences like the Mrs. Ganush’s arm in Christines throat I can’t go without at least saying it’s dated. It’s especially frustrating when this film HAS physical props and practical effects and are effective in their use. The overall story is also super messy, especially with the inclusion Rham Jas, a hole in the wall fortune teller played by Dileep Rao, who has all the knowledge of the curse and spiritual threats that Christine has to face, but tells the information to her in fragments and has connections to the demon bounty hunter woman from the beginning, who also just kinda has to get thrown in the the third act of this film for the climax.\n Yet even so, I can’t say I was ever checked out of this film except for one specific element that I think was the biggest distraction for me, and that was the entire subplot around Justin Long’s Character Clay. Clay is Christine’s successful, generationally wealthy, supportive boyfriend who begins not really understanding what Christine is going through but never really negative towards HER about it. He more so just wants to understand and what I would consider as supportive even if skeptic. They try to make him seem shitty by how skeptical and I guess you could say disrespectful he is during Christine’s Initial visit with Rham, but even so his character’s inclusion never bothered me. That is until one scene where Christine has an outburst as she’s being teased by the demon curse while at dinner with Clay’s family. Clay then kinda leave’s the picture for a while, as Christine further investigates and finds out she needs like $10,000 to reach the demon bounty hunter lady, sells all her possessions to go so, this movie get’s fucking wild, and i’m not even mentioning the fucking kitten thing. And when she’s about to give up because she just short of the money she needs, fuckin CLay swoops back in and is just like “here’s the money, oh btw I believe you.”\n\nCOOL GUY!\nBut other than that element, I never officially checked myself out of this film even through it’s silliness. Other factors at play is there’s some stiff acting at play specifically from our lead, but there’s enough good scares in this and genuinely great and horrific scenes to make this one worth a revisit at some point. While on the topic I do intend on putting films from the first watch slice into the rewatch slice, after some time has passed of course. I think it could be fun to return to a film and catalog any changes in my opinions. The circumstances around this were nice too, I of course watched it with my girlfriend which is always nice. And while I don’t think she particularly loved it, I think it was a fun experience for the both of us. That final scene especially had us going, iykyk. But that’s about all I really gotta say about this film, I think it could be especially fun in a group setting, not a film that's gonna knock your socks off but a fun ride nonetheless. Grade: C\n\n",

I haven't seen it before, but now it's definitely on my watch list - just like Babak, for example.\n\nThe next stop - I'm going alphabetically - is in Eastern Europe: We're now finally leaving the letter A and go to **Belarus** instead. As in the previous days, please note the following information:\n\n* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.\n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to only name one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

Look at Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, for instance. They should have hired Paul Rudnick, but instead they hired… the creators of Smallville.\n\nWe’re not getting new classics because Hollywood isn’t putting the work into its scripts the way they used to.\n\nAs someone who thrives off movies, personally it’s really disheartening to think that maybe this is it. Maybe we’ll get one or two good ‘fluke’ comedies every few decades from now on and that’s it.\n\nAnd to be honest, now more than ever, I feel like we need them in society. Maybe they’re actually IMPORTANT to society. 🤷‍♂️ Just a thought.",

        "title": "It's no superhero fatique. It's just that the superhero boom might be over",
        "selftext": "I think you already know this but in the late 90's - early 2000's, there was an abundance of comic book movies, some classics like Blade, Spider-Man 1-3, and the X-Men movies. As the years have passed, the wave has gotten bigger, with the iconic Dark Knight Trilogy, and the MCU (and ig the DCEU too). We reached a point in the late 2010's when these movies were money printing machines. It didnt matter if your movie was a mediocre slogfest with D tier comic book characters, it was mostly gonna make double or triple of it's initial budget. \n\nBut now we live in a world where this era is over. With some expections, we've seen so many of these movies end up financial failures. Even movies that 5 years ago would've made billions of dollars, now it seems like superhero movies are competing for the title of the worst performing movie.\n\nA lot of people might say that this is the result of the superhero fatique. Basically, people are just sick of superheroes, supervillains, and pretty much anything resembling a comic book movie is avoided like the plague. \n\nAt a surface level, you might say that this is true. With movies like Joker 2, The Marbles,  Morbius, Madame Web, Thor Love and Thunder, Black Adam (and pretty much every single post Aquaman DCEU movie).  All of these movies were embarrassing failures.\n\nBut since I'm on this subreddit, I think we can agree that this is just not true. It's not that superhero movies are avoided, but that they lost the superpower to be money printing machines. There isnt anything special about Marvel movies and DC movies anymore, it doesn't matter if your movie is part of some connedted universe, or even if it's a sequel to a highly successful movie. \n\nSuperhero/comic book movies have become just another genre of movies. When Hollywood is about to release a superhero movie, they need to polish it and market it like it's any other movie. They need to actually put effort into making a movie people will spend their hard earned money to see on the big screen. The only difference between a Marvel movie and some action movie starring a washed out actor is that these movies have absurdly high budgets, and that they might stir some political discussion that most of the goes nowhere and after it's over they just throw in the trash (exceot for Hollywood since the forced performative progressive ideologies have been proven to be painful for the box office income of these movies).\n\nIn general we could say that nowadays, people will go watch a movie only if they really want to go watch. Gone are the days people were about to spend money seeing a B movie cause they're bored. And there's nothing wrong with watching less popular movies, just saying that people are very picky about what they're about to watch. If your movie has a chappy marketing campaign or got itself into some controversy, you might as well not release that movie. It's actually pretty fascinating. It's like a battle where only the strongest will come out. It's a harsh competition, and no movie is getting spared from the wrath of the audience. \n\nYes, people like you. You have the power to influence the movie industry. Your wallet has more power than you would think. You are the judge. You got the power, so use it wisely.\n",

The cinephile in me is giddy with joy when he sees such wonderful 'small' films on popular platforms like Jio Cinema, which also hosts Big Boss (you will know the difference if you are from India) .\n\nNow, I am not going to spoil the film for you, but it's a brave take on sexual exploration, body positivity, and a tender bond that develops between a young sex worker and an old-school teacher.\n\nThe film is a series of conversations that are so intelligently woven together that it qualifies for some of the best writing that I have come across. The film reminded me of the Before trilogy in parts too, but the setting made it more intimate and personal.\n\nNow imagine, watching a film on body positivity and the OTT platform you decide to watch it on, deciding to blur all the nude scenes. The entire point of the film is to own your body. Be content with your sexuality. Accept yourself with all the flaws that you have.\n\nYet, the custodians of culture decided to blur a full frontal nude scene of Emma Thompson, an actor in her 60s, who probably has given her best in this film.\n\nYet, I am reminded that no, you have no right to see an old woman feeling liberated for the first time in her body because they aren't part of our culture!\n\nNo wonder most women in India fake orgasms their entire life.",

This just made it harder when she moved on and Tom was left broken. I don’t think either were in the wrong and that things go like that sometimes.

Other than that though I feel the story really weighted this movie down a lot. It all felt so random and only made just enough sense to keep going. I feel like the devil being in the dolls and causing the father's to kill is just not a great story. Also how did neither Lee or Carter noticed that his daughters birthday was the 13th? It seemed all so predictable and I just don't think it was really any good at all. Essentially after all the hype I thought I would be in for a wild movie but it just fell flat for me. Am I the only one that thinks this or was this movie just WAY overhyped?",

Perhaps because I was quite young when I saw it or maybe it's the novelty factor, but I still get excited when I watch it. Particularly certain scenes involving the kids and the dinosaurs are exhilarating. And I'm a big fan of the cast (well, most, but that's a long story).\n\nAnother one was Tremors. I still go back and watch it, it's the right combo of horror, adventure, and humor.\n\nDo you have any favorites? Please share.",

        "selftext": "Recently watched a movie called dampyr. Suggest watching it before reading forward as there will be minor spoilers.\n\n\nHere are a couple reasons I think this movie is propaganda:\n\nThis movie has very strongly queer coded vampires.\n\nThere is a soldier whos backstory is that his son died, and they only give us one photo of the son with short hair, and then a scene of the son with long hair asking why his dad left him.\n\nA scene at the end of first act that refers to a war very vaguely, and one at the end talking about how this is the only war that matters. Just seems vague enough to feel like a dog whistle\n\nI don't want to say anything too specific because that would be a lot of typing, and also because it's best to watch it yourself.\n\n If you don't, what do you think about queer coding villians specifically, because it is a common theme. Is that a form of propaganda? Is it homophobic? What're your thoughts.\n\nTo those that do watch it, did you catch any of those moments for dampyr or am I overthinking?\n\n\n\n",

Moffat can write character relationships and dialogue as well as anyone, and can balance adventure, horror, comedy, mystery, and sci-fi elements all in one story. Verbinski can impose clarity on even the most complicated scripts, and handles adventure, horror, etc. just as well as Moffat. Both gifted, creative storytellers with complementary strengths who I’d honestly just love to see make more stuff. \n\nI tested this question on a couple friends. One said Tom Hanks doing a Sorkin script (presumably forgetting Tom killed it in Charlie Wilson’s War). Another said Ernst Lubitsch directing a William Goldman script (presumably forgetting I’m a degenerate who doesn’t know film history that well). \n\nDon’t worry about boring stuff like if they would get along or were alive at the same time. And consider this permission to show off deep knowledge of the industry, or personality/interpersonal dynamics, or your own love of particular artists. ",

Surf Dracula comes from a tweet about how it used to be if there was a show called Surf Dracula, he'd be surfing every week. Now, there would be 8 episodes about how he got the surfboard, then we'd onyl seem him surf in the last 5 minutes.  \n  \nThus, a Surf Dracula is a fireworks factory where the fireworks factory is the entire premise. This comes up a lot in prequels. I was thinking about Madame Web & how it's perhaps the biggest Surf Dracula ever. Dracula doesn't even get the surfboard, much less ride it & we only see him with it for less than a minute in a dream sequence, but it ends with us knowing he's going to get a surfboard in the future. Then, I realized the finale of that movie takes place in a fireworks factory & I wondered if the writers did this to us on purpose. ",

        "selftext": "I realize this is really picking nits, but I’m always taken out of the moment when a horror movie monster villain has an enormous, reverberating, multitimbral voice in a setting where it’s sonically impossible. For example, Vecna (Stranger Things) is in a scene taking place in a small, cluttered, room yet has a voice that echoes as if he’s in some cavernous, empty room but when human characters speak it sounds natural and appropriate for the setting. There’s this small dissonance that just makes everything seem silly and takes all the scares away.\n\nAnother example is the Exorcist, this tiny little child has a chorus of thunderous voices emanating from her skull? How?\n\nI’d like to see an example of something really scary looking that has realistic vocalizations. Personally, I think the Exorcist would be a lot more frightening if a depraved, faint, demonic voice accompanied the character.\n\nJust my two cents y’all. LMK  your thoughts.\n\nEdit: Should have flagged *unpopular opinion",

He was 86 years of age.\n\nMorrissey’s archivist Michael Chaiken told The Hollywood Reporter the filmmaker died in the early morning of Oct. 28 at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City after a bout with pneumonia. His most celebrated films as an auteur include Flesh, Trash, Heat, Flesh for Frankenstein and the classic B-picture Blood for Dracula, which starred Joe Dallesandro.\n\nMorrissey’s films also included classics like Women in Revolt and the 1980s New York City trilogy Forty Deuce, Mixed Blood and Spike of Bensonhurst. But it’s Morrissey’s early association with pop artist Andy Warhol that helped establish him as a director and kept his cult status alive throughout his career.",

I was a BIG fan of Miss Binoche after I saw \"The English Patient\". As a gay teen, I related a lot with Hana, which is odd but something about her character in that movie made her endearing to me. And I was so happy when she won the oscar over Lauren Bacall's overrated performance in \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" AKA Barbra turns hot by looking like Ron Perlman in Beast Drag. \n\n\"Chocolate\" was the springboard for her, proof \"The English Patient\" wasn't a one hit wonder for her, it solidified her status in Hollywood as a star. She could have been France's biggest international star since Leslie Caron. But she chose a consistent film career in France over staying in Hollywood. And she was probably right. France values its divas and provides juicy roles for women. \n\nAt 36, Binoche's chances of being offered great parts might have been temporary and then limited to supporting roles. Or typecast as the foreign mother of Amanda Bynes or Shailene Woodley. Even Danielle Darrieux faced that tragic fate in the 1950s when she tried America. \n\nSo, overall, I'm happy Binoche stayed in France and did the occasional supporting role in America.",

        "selftext": "I'm not a big movie buff, but I want to learn why *Chinatown* by Polanski is seen as a great film. I decided to watch it because Netflix tagged it as an award-winning movie.\n\nI’m usually not a fan of slower-paced films focused on story and dialogue, like The Godfather. While I don’t personally enjoy The Godfather, I can understand why others do. But with Chinatown, I don’t get it.\n\nThe plot didn’t feel particularly unique to me, and a lot of events seemed to happen just because the story needed them to. For instance, the kiss between Cross and Gittes felt forced, like it was only there to push the story forward. There are too many coincidences that felt unrealistic to me as a viewer. Scenes like Gittes hitting Cross to demand answers about his daughter/sister came off as over-the-top, almost like a soap opera. \n\nAs for the themes of corruption and politics, didn’t seem especially deep. It just felt like the classic idea that the wealthy can control laws and justice, which could fit right into a typical Netflix movie and be seen as cliché.\n\nAs for the acting, I didn’t feel it was especially memorable, even though I think it won awards for acting. The acting felt more like a soap opera with lots of cigarettes and extremely exaggerated reactions but at the same time flat.\n\n**As I said at the beginning, my intention is to understand why this movie is good, not to belittle it.**",

It bears re-watching several times because there are a lot of fun bits throughout. Sure, there is cartoon slapstick - but also serious pathos, and a tightly written script.\n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "Now i know that nowadays corporations like Disney or Warner tend to prefer IPs and franchises like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Harry Potter etc. over original ideas and most of the time if they do that it result in flops (likely because the studios never believes in an original idea) and i know some people might getting tired of franchises and reboots of popular movies but just thinking cinema is now reduced to that is for me at least kind of an exageration.\n\nFirst reboots always existed before the 2000s. For a few examples the 1990s Psycho trilogy or the King Kong movie of the 1970s or even Scarface with Al Pacino was in fact a remake of 1932 Scarface. Disney also did remake 101 Dalmatians back in the 90s and did 2 live action movies. Hollywood isn't much new to rehash old ideas and capitalize on it with nostalgia or just willing that the people will just go out to see it based on the title and what they're rebooting. Also they did out-of-time sequels of very old movies too like Return to Oz sequel to the Wizard of Oz (who also had some reboots and remakes over time) in 1985 exactly 40+ years after the original came out.\n\nSecond point is that there are always new ideas out there despite what there's on the market right now. On a side sure we have Avengers Doomsday & Secret Wars, new Star Wars movies and other franchise or IP related content. But on the other side there are movies or new IPs who i can see becoming cult movies in the next few decades whatever is an original idea or an already existing proprety or franchises that is just becoming popular now.\n\nThe Holdovers, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Terrifier, Dune, Superman and the whole new DCU, Mickey 17, Civil War, Challengers, The Bikeriders, Trap, The Last Airbender animated movie (which became popular during the pandemic thanks to Netflix) and literally every A24 movie. I can see people looking back on those movies in like 2040 and remember it like people grew up in the 80s remembered Star Wars or E.T. or Friday the 13th.\n\nThen i could be wrong. I'm writing this after i saw a discussion like this on another sub who said exactly that and if you think that cinema is just sequels or reboots is totally fair and i'm not to try to convince everyone and just saying an opinion that can be wrong. But like i say i am just sick to see people pretend that there can't be any new idea or franchise beside already existing ones.\n\nYou can be free to express you thoughts but just remember be civil in express your thoughts and not be too harsh in responding ok ?",

What are the chances of finding obscure British films made in the early 1900s?\n\nSo far, I have managed to find out that a production company called Magnet Films used it as a filming location for a film in 1914. I am not sure on the turn around time for films of that era but there was also a war on so maybe film was released between 1914 and 1918?\n\nOthers where filmed there between 1906 and 1911 but I don't know the names of the films. If I can find this or if it even still exists, it will be the last time the gardens would have been in \"Full Bloom\" so to speak. ",

        "title": "Why Wasn't The Hobbit Trilogy as good as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy?",
        "selftext": "I think most would agree that the LOTR trilogy is much better than The Hobbit trilogy.  The Hobbit trilogy could have been close to as epic as the LOTR trilogy but it just didn't have the magic IMO.  It didn't feel as epic.  Trying to put my finger on why that is.  Here are some ideas.  What do you think?\n\n* The dwarves are slapstick.  I feel like LOTR had a more serious tone and the dwarves were always singing and have the equivalent of fart humor for the most part.  In LOTR there was a sense of dread and foreboding when it came to the threat of Sauron, Saruman, the Nazgul etc...\n* We aren't introduced to very many new and unique places.  Many locations are re-hashes of old locations we have been to or similar places that we have been to.  We are introduced to so many new places in the LOTR trilogy in every movie.  Just think of Fellowship - The Shire, Bree, Isengard, Rivendell, The mountain pass of Caradhras, Mines of Moria,, Lothlórien, The Gates of Argonath.  None of the Hobbit movies come close to introducing that many cool new locations.  I will say the whole Necromancer / Gandalf subplot was great.  This was a new location with a new / powerful threat.  If only the rest of the trilogy could be at that level.\n* Over reliance on CGI.  The LOTR CGI was cleaner and blended better with the practical effects.  Some of the Hobbit CGI was overdone and fake looking IMO.\n* Messing up Logolas' character.  He went from badass hero in LOTR to a jealous boyfriend type in the Hobbit movies.\n* Pacing - The Hobbit was stretched to thin vs the source material.  LOTR was three books.  The Hobbit was one book.  Too much time spent trying to fill in the gaps so that Tolkien's work isn't there as much.\n* The villains weren't as scary.  Besides a brief encounter with the Necromancer the villains weren't as bad in The Hobbit trilogy.  Nothing was as threatening as Sauron, Saruman, the Nazgul, etc...    Azog is just big orc and Smaug talked too much IMO.  I mean after having a 20 minute conversation with Bilbo he just didn't seem as threatening.  The Great Goblin wasn't scary at all.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

Following the official list of european nations by the Council of Europe in alphabetical order, I want to create a list of the most popular movie set in each given country. Yesterday, it was Austria's turn, and to a certain extent in keeping with the heights of the Alps, this was also the thread with the highest participation to date.\n\nI was a bit surprised by two things: On the one hand, I find it remarkable that not a single James Bond film was actually mentioned. On the other hand, I really expected *The Sound of Music* to win. However, this film is almost completely unknown in German-speaking countries and especially in Austria itself. That's why another film has won here, which many may not even know in the original, but in the U.S. 1:1 remake by the same director: ***Funny Games***.\n\nNow that we've sorted that out, we're heading straight to the next country today: **Azerbaijan**. The rules are as follows:\n\n* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, espeically when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.\n* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to only name one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!\n\nI'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!\n\n>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games\n\n>Day 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl. The Color of Pomegranade)\n\n>Day 2: Andorra - El fred que crema (engl.: The Burning Cold)\n\n>Day 1: Albania - Lulekuqët mbi Mure (engl.: Red Poppies on Walls)",

        "selftext": "\"Chaos is order yet undeciphered.\"\n\n\n\nEnemy was exhilarating, I was so tensed during the whole movie about what was going on and couldn't look away. Even if you set aside the doppelganger plot of the movie, the world and details in it that Denis Villeneuve created are beautifully exhausting and suffocating. I was taking screenshots and zooming in to a scene of a character turning off lights because I wanted to see if the design of the switches mean the setting is a dystopian one, that's what this movie was doing to me lol\n\nIt has this dystopain kafka-esque feeling to it that you can't stop what's happening and you don't know what's happening. The city in Enemy has this perpetual yellow haze over it that seems to wash over on everything and affect the characters as well as what's going on in their minds. The two characters often have vivid dreams of the city scape with a giant deformed spider walking above it and it seems to represent to me, this influence of ugliness and stagnant-ness. It's like a cloud of yellow exhausting cancer over everything which detoriates itself into people's subconciousness and makes them do ugly things. \n\nRegardless of whether or not you understand it or not or whether there is something to understand about it, Enemy is a suffocating, beautifully acted and well-directed movie that evokes feelings in me that movies rarely do.\n\nIt's a very focused and well constructed movie, like details I mentioned feel intentional, like they mean something or maybe they don't and it's just a stylistic choice.\n\nI loved it, 7.5/10",

That it's about Native American genocide. That all of the continuity errors involving the layout of the Overlook MUST be intentional. So many theories about what the final shot of the movie means...\n\nBut Stanley Kubrick said that it was just a story about a man driven insane by ghosts and his own inner demons, and Jack is the reincarnation of the previous caretaker. There's not that much more to it. This hasn't stopped theorists, who insist that either Kubrick was lying, or that it doesn't matter if he says that the curtains are blue, death of the author means that they can interpret the curtains being blue as meaning whatever they want.\n\nSo what other movies are overanlyzed, where fans see things that were clearly not intended by the creators?

I especially feel awkward when watching a new movie—or one I want to rewatch—with my mother, and the plot is centered around a father and son. For some reason, when I see a new movie with that kind of storyline, I feel bad or some sort of pity for my mother, since neither of us can relate to it. I’ve only ever thought about this and have never shared it with anyone. Has anyone ever felt the same? And yes I do know about some movies that do have a primarily mother and son story.",

Never show information that doesn't matter. If someone had flickering lights at their house and mentions it. Those lights will go out during a shootout or an important moment. If someone keeps tieing their shoe. That shoelace will cause a major moment change later in the movie. \n\nIf you start to see specific cinematography cues, things becomes super obvious. Like two people always being in blue background light together and then something happens and all of a sudden the 2nd person is under red background light. It's all subtle but it's a huge unsaid thing but it shows change in the relationship of characters. \n\nThere's a lot of examples of cases of things like this and it's almost ruined film for me because I start analyzing every aspect of a movie once I see patterns, and I start looking for the next pattern. I see an obvious hint and I'm like..okay well there's the surprise for later. That's no fun. \n\nDo you guys feel like this at all or what yours relationship with film?",

The only mention I see of anything related to SFF is at the beginning it says something like \"sometime in the near future\".

But making the killer the very detective who works alongside Cross always felt a little… just ok? I mean it makes for a decent reveal I guess, but also feels so forced considering how crucial he was to the investigation. \n\nIn Se7en we have the complete opposite — the villain’s actor gets no billing in the marketing or opening credits and we don’t see his face until near the end. \n\nI think in comedy movies, having a killer be a main cast member does make sense — Clue, Club Dread, Murder Mystery, etc, where it feels more like you’re invited to play a game of Clue as the story progresses. But for darker and serious thrillers I find the “it was secondary protagonist all along” trope a little tiresome and predictable. I think more often than not it works so much better as a complete stranger to the protagonist, which is how it would go down 99% of the time in real life.",

It feels uncanny seeing the political side of the war alongside the carnage of it on an even scale.

Forman refused the offer, considering Matthau to be too old for the role, since he was more than 60, and Mozart only lived to be 35.\n\nHowever, Matthau shed some light on this. On the Los Angeles Times and I quote, Matthau said: “I wanted to play Salieri in ‘Amadeus.’ I called Milos Forman, who directed it, and I said, ‘Listen Milos, I want to play Mozart.’ He said, ‘ *Mozart died at 36* .’ I said, ‘That’s all right. I can play 36.’ ” Matthau’s deadpan expression broke slightly and a hint of a smile curled his lips. “See, I thought he would say, ‘You’re not right for Mozart, you can possibly play Salieri.’ But he never suggested it.”\n\nI think what happened was that Matthau did wanted to be in Amadeus, but as Antonio Salieri. However, he kind of ruined it with his deadpan joke on wanting to play Amadeus as Milos really didn't get the joke.\n\nHere is the article- [Walter Matthau: TV Actor? - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-03-04-tv-2329-story.html)\n\nAll in All, What if Walter Matthau was in Amadeus & played the lead role of Antonio Salieri?",

I don't know if it was the sleep deprivation or if I'm just now realizing something that was obvious this whole time, but this movie is something else. Aside from getting a lot of the humor that I didn't pick up on when I was young, I realized just how disturbing the whole premise is, and how it drew upon many other thriller and horror movies of its time. I think I always realized that Sid's house was pretty creepy, but it goes so much further than that. \n\nA group of sentient beings live in constant fear of their true nature being discovered by their \"owners.\" Despite this, they feel benevolence toward the oppressors, probably due to Stockholm Syndrome. \n\nBuzz Lightyear, a being among the group of oppressed suffers from paranoid delusions as a coping mechanism. Upon learning that his entire self-identity is a lie, and that he is actually one of a group of mass produced pawns, he attempts suicide in a delusional stupor, and loses a limb in the process.\n\nA particularly sadistic owner (Sid) commits genocidal acts against the toys, from exploding them for fun to performing atrocious experiments on them. At one point, he tortures Woody by burning him, telling him \"we have methods for making you talk.\" The movie makes clear that he does this all for his own pleasure.\n\nThe genocidal experiments make the film one of the most notorious body horror pictures of the '90s. Toys are mutilated beyond recognition at the whim of sadistic Sid. \n\nThere's other components, like the group of alien toys that know nothing outside of the machine in which they reside, creating an entire cult-like religion with their god, the claw. There's the mob justice the group of toys carry out against their leader, throwing him out a high window as punishment. Whole movie is gnarly. 10/10",

        "selftext": "Dogma 95 was a manifesto signed and published by Danish film directors Thomas Vinterberg and Lars Von Trier in 1995. This manifesto consists of ten rules to be followed, the so-called vows of chastity, which should serve as a guide for the production of future films. This should lead to the renunciation of various accommodations or production conventions in the making of films on the part of the filmmakers, such as\n\n«\\[…\\] 3. it is only allowed to shoot with one camera. \\[…\\] 5. Optical manipulation is forbidden, as is the use of filters. \\[…\\] 6. The film must not contain any superficial action. (Murder, weapons, etc. are not allowed.) \\[sic!\\] 7. temporal or geographical distortion is forbidden. (This means that the movie must take place in the here and now.) \\[sic!\\] \\[…\\] 9. The film format must be 35mm Academy».\n\nThis is a counter-movement to the auteur theory of the 60s. Many films made according to these Dogma 95 rules violate some of these vows of chastity, which makes the films seem even more ironic.\n\nUnder these -and other- circumstances, the movie “Idiots” was produced by Lars Von Trier (aforementioned founder of the Dogma 95 movement), which is about a commune of young adults who prank other people by pretending to be disabled. The plot begins with a middle-aged woman who joins them to put a terrible event from her private life behind her.\n\nThe movie «Idiots» was filmed in a very atypical format for movies of that time. Although the film was later transferred to 35mm for theatrical release, it was shot entirely on a Sony DCR-VX1000 videocamera. At the time, this recording device was often used by skateboarders, but was originally designed by Sony for the broadcast industry, giving the film a documentary feel unlike most movies shot on roll film.\n\nBut was this documentary effect only due to the director’s choice of camera? What can we say about the other conditions of Dogma 95? What influence did they have on the finished film?\n\nAs Marshall Mcluhan once wrote, «the medium is the message», it would make more sense to say the following about the movie «Idioten» (original title in Danish: Idioterne): «Dogma 95 is the movie». The rules under which Lars von Trier made «Idiots» have a certain relevance that we cannot neglect. Therefore, in this short essay, we will examine to what extent the observance (or non-observance) of the Dogma criteria correlates with the «documentary» effect of the film Idioterne (1998).\n\n*Continue reading at:* [https://kinolingua.com/lars-von-triers-idiots-a-realistic-movie-under-the-criteria-of-dogma-95/#more-2197](https://kinolingua.com/lars-von-triers-idiots-a-realistic-movie-under-the-criteria-of-dogma-95/#more-2197)",

        "selftext": "I just saw the movie the first time and well, am I the only person that got a huge ick and very uncomfortable watching the movie?  The acting and story telling were excellent, so from that standpoint, the movie was great.  But the themes/characters in the movie made me very uncomfortable and icky and the characters themselves were morally not great, other than Clementine who was just living her life freely and got pulled into all of this.  I think they made the male characters very relatable to many males out there, which was very smart of the movie creators, but is also what made it very icky.\n\n  \nSPOILERS: This is just my take on the whole thing:\n\n>!**Joel**: Middle aged introverted socially awkward insecure male who doesn't know himself that well and has low levels of emotional intelligence/social skills. Similar to many middle aged males out there, he is not living a fulfilling life and has little or no sense of direction. Meets and finds Clementine attractive because she is a younger hotter female who is able to live in the present and live life freely.  Basically, he's attracted to her because of her 'free spirt' energy, and more into what she makes him feel rather than her as a person.  It's like your middle aged office male falling for a rave girl.  Clementine even mentions that that's why guys are into her - the excitement and the ups and downs due to her impulsiveness, giving them something interesting in otherwise their mundane life - but not actually into her as a person.  And I'd imagine the good sex that comes with it to. This is evident though Joel's inability to commit to her, and lack of desire to have kids with her.  He sees her as a source of entertainment and excitement and escapism from his boring life, while she actually is looking for some sort of romantic, LTR.  As a typical insecure person would do, Joel also makes assumptions that she'd cheat on him, because he doesn't understand the free spirt style of life.  But Clementine is just being herself.  Anyways, Joel gives me mid levels of ick.!<\n\n>!**Clementine**: She literally comes off like just a young free spirit girl like you could find at a rave or festival.  Impulsives, has some mental health problems (she admits to anxiety, prone to boredom), but values living life to the fullest and being in the present.  For whatever reason she's into Joel - no ideal why, maybe he seems to be a good person and stable and consistent.  No ick here!<\n\n>!**Dr. Howard**: High levels of ick.  Forcefully erases memories from Mary without her consent to cover things up. Runs a questionable medical practice - people seem to either regret or have side effects greater than what they were told (like getting drunk).  Even though Mary seemed to be the one coming on to him, he still has a wife and kids.!<\n\n>!**Patrick**: Straight up predator, preying on vulnerable and emotional unstable women (like Clementine).  Most likely into her the same way Joel is, but from a predatory standpoint manipulative druggy/rapey standpoint.  Joel just into her from the lack of direction standpoint.  Huge huge ick. Seems like the predators you'd find at clubs or raves.!<\n\n>!**Mary**: Directionless female, who happens to be into older men.  She's young so get's a pass but minor ick.!<\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I decided I’d just google it later, but now I can’t remember what they said it was from. So now I’m hoping someone here is more educated than me and can tell me what the leg lamp is originally from.\n\nTLDR: I have little pop culture knowledge and am now wondering if the leg lamp is originally from A Christmas Story or from something else I’ve never seen",

He's so effortlessly a blend of snide and caring, lazily indifferent and ruthlessly compassionate in the same line. Laughing with SS Officers while openly saving victims right in front of their faces and throwing money around like it was on fire. \n\nI don't know how much of that was from the Director, how much was in the script and how much the actor decided to throw in himself but I was stunned, horrified and impressed at once. \n\nThe ending speech is one of the best ones I've ever seen in a film, not the one where he's in the factory but the one where he's about to leave in his car for the last time. \n\nI watched several documentaries on Youtube this week on the ultimate fate of Schindler and that is something which would have changed the ending and message of the movie considerably which is why I think they left it out. \n\nIt's the functional equivalent to seeing Abraham Lincoln survive the end of The Civil War only to end up as a penniless news columnist only getting by through generous donations sent by freed Slaves until his dying days.",

Yesterday it was Armenia's turn (I work according to the list of nations counted as European countries by the Council of Europe) - and we had a clear winner: **Նռան գույնը** (engl. The Color of Pomegranade).\n\nOnce again, this is simply a film that I not only haven't seen yet, but also haven't heard of - so thank you for your active help, especially from Armenia itself. I'm going in alphabetical order here and so far it's mainly been countries that have been less prominent in English-language mainstream cinema. Today that's changing, because... we're going to **Austria**. Sure, I could think of a few more countries, but I can imagine that the list of film suggestions today will become longer than for any previous country.\n\nThe rules are the same as everyday: It's about where the movie is set, not filmed. Winner is the movie comment with the most upvotes in this thread. So please, so check if yours is mentioned before you post it in a comment.\n\n\n\nDay 3: Armenia - Նռան գույնը (engl.

For me, it's around 2007. There's something about movies from before then that just *feel* like a different era, from a visual standpoint. After that though, it all kinda melds together. ",

A typical \"two actors who you can never imagine seeing together on screen and they work marvelously\". \n\nThe critics talking there mentioning this is probably the best Tim Allen role AND that he was not the first choice and he had to fight for it, was something I knew about but hearing it and seeing it makes the casting so much more precious\n\nLoved how the documentary was structured and I will probably rewatch it as multiple times as the movie itself.\n\nI recently watched a documentary about Deep Space Nine and I seriously got an impression the creators and actors could not stand each other (it obviously was not the case because it ran for 7 years but the contrast was obvious)",

        "title": "\"The Haunted Mansion\" (2003) is still one of my guilty pleasures!",
        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/zou8wb1b89xd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=861f9e03f3c682eb2987cc89d51aa3e72e5d8965\n\n**The Haunted Mansion (2003)** has definitely become one of my guilty pleasures.  \nI’ve probably watched it around eight times now, first on TV when it came out, then on various Streaming Platforms over the years. Every rewatch reminds me why it’s such a nostalgic favorite for me, especially around Halloween. I never understood the criticism it got back then (or still get´s today) because honestly, it’s just plain fun!\n\nTo me, the characters are one of the movie's biggest strengths.  \nEddie Murphy as \"*Jim Evers*\" is hilarious as the somewhat clueless real estate Agent, and his character stays funny without ever crossing into annoying territory. He keeps you laughing from start to finish, and the rest of the cast brings their own charm, too. Really liked Terence Stamp as \"*Ramsley*\", or Jenifer Tilly as \"*Leota*\".  \nEvery character has their place, and even if some actors stand out more than others, they’re all likable and add to the movie’s fun vibe.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the set design, seriously impressive. The Great Hall and the Crypt look straight out of a classic haunted mansion, creating a perfect atmosphere without going overboard. Every room in these Scenes feels carefully crafted. The creature designs were also really cool, cause they add a creepy but fun vibe that feels right for this kind of family-friendly horror. Some of the CGI Effects aged not that great, but they didn´t go overboard with it so it doesn´t bothered me too much.\n\nAlso the story itself is easy to follow, and it has a good flow from start to finish. It doesn’t feel overloaded with random twists or characters, which is one of the main reasons i prefer it over the 2023 version, which felt scattered by comparison. The 2003 movie keeps things simple, which makes it much more enjoyable.\n\nMark Mancina’s score is another highlight. The music is haunting and atmospheric, always setting a perfect tone for both the spooky and funny parts.\n\nAnd, of course, there are those classic scenes that make The Haunted Mansion unforgettable for me:  \nThe Opening Scene, the Singing Busts, the Crypt, Madame Leota’s Séance. These are the moments that stay with you, and they’re a big part of why i keep coming back to this movie. They make it memorable in a way the 2023 Version could not, even though it tried to throw in almost every character from the ride.\n\nNow, i just watched it again for Halloween 2024, and it hasn’t lost any of its charm.  \nI honestly don’t get the hate. It’s entertaining from start to finish. If i had to pick, i would watch this over the new 2023 Version any day. And i gave the new Version a chance. But i can´t remember anything about it other then the cast was good (and that it was very dark).\n\nThat said, i’d still love to see someone take a shot at adapting **Phantom Manor** from Disneyland Paris.  \nWith its darker, more mysterious vibe, it could make for an incredible companion movie to the 2003 Haunted Mansion.",

        "selftext": "Recently I came across a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/n0v3nb/i_totally_misunderstood_lady_in_the_water/?sort=new)here made 4 years ago. At the same time, a big anime(Japanese animation show) has celebrated its 25 years of being in the air by producing a special episode called \"[One Piece Fan Latter](https://www.netflix.com/title/81947352)\". And I couldn't help but connect both, I hope you all forgive me as I am going to talk partially about something that isn't a movie.\n\nThe special is a side story that has nothing to do with the main story, instead tells the story of a group of normal people that in one way or another were affected positively by the main characters of the main story. From just being a fan of their music, being inspired by them, or straight up thanking them for the life of his brother as they gave him the strength to save his young sibling in the middle of a war.\n\nThe episode keeps using the symbolism of those people putting their \"puzzle piece\" of a jigsaw as they remember what the main characters have done to them, how they were inspired by them all to form a light, a path to a better future you could say. At one point, even one of the characters talks about how every single thing that happens has led him to the path he is now. This immediately reminded me of one of the quotes of one of my favorite movies \"Men think they're each alone in this world. That is not true. One act can one day affect all\"\n\n\"The Lady in the Water\"- M Night Shyamalan, 2006 is a movie that is often misunderstood and polarizing. I am not saying that what the user HolyGonzo posted that day 4 years ago is wrong, because it isn't, but they miss or didn't put too much emphasis on a single detail. The fact that the Co-protagonist is literally called Story. Stories have a power that is only there for those who find it. They may even have the power to overcome adversities in the lives of people.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a man, Cleveland, running a department building and how he is suffering from the tragic loss of his family Until the day he finds (a) \"Story\". Metting this \"Story\" helped him cope with his loss and help him in healling himself and cope with his lost. When he first thought he was going to help the \"Story\" he discovered that in the process she was the one that helped him. Did you get the symbolism now?\n\nThe movie talks about the power of a story, how it can literally change lives and maybe one day even affect the whole world in ways we might not even be aware of. As the movie explains with the example of \"The cooking book\".\n\nHolyGonzo's post explains how the characters in the story represent different aspects of the recovering and self-healing of Cleveland but I think it has another layer we can get a meaning of when we talk about stories.\n\n   \\- The Guild not only represents the people who will support us but also I think it represents a fandom. A group of people we go online for and talk about our favorite stories and how they can genuinely help us in life.\n\n   \\- The Symbolist not only drives meaning in the mundane and thus helps in finding meaning in life but it also represents us as a fandom making theories and symbolism about our favorite shows and movies or even us as we find joy or meaning on mundane stories.\n\n   \\- The Guardian not only represents the strength to overpass traumas but it represents the power we find in stories that are important to us.\n\n   \\- Finally, the Healer being the role of the main character of the movie not only represents us as we ultimately are the ones with the power of healing ourselves but also how stories can help in that process of self-healing.\n\n  \\- The movie critic in a meta way represents exactly that, a critic who doesn't see beyond his experience as a critic. He dismisses the metaphors and symbolism people believe are in a story, symbolism that may or may not be intended by the authors of the stories but that can help us move through life.\n\nThis is where I go back to One Piece Fan Letter. One Piece was first realized in 1997 as a comic. This means that One Piece as a story has been around for almost 30 years and its fandom keeps getting bigger and bigger every year.\n\nErgo One Piece Fan Letter is not only about this group of fictional characters being inspired by other fictional characters in the same universe but is about how these fictional characters have affected us in real life. The internet is not short of videos and posts talking about how One Piece has changed their life. The longevity of this story have make this very clear. A year ago or so I remember a post rooming around about a fan diagnosed with cancer and how his biggest regret was not being alive for the finale of One Piece.\n\nI think this is a perfect example of what The Lady in the Water is about. How stories, fictional or not, help us in many ways. Stories have power, do not let any critic change your mind or change the meaning that you find in them. We all are connected, I do to believe that the action of someone can one day change the world and a story is the perfect way to do so.\n\n***TL;DR***\\- The Lady in the Water is about how stories can help us overcome real life adversities. How the small action of writing a story can save the lives of many people only if we accept them first and we do the first step in the process of self-healing.",

        "selftext": "Not sure where else to post this but here, however trying to watch Cars has made me want to rant about this.\n\nI am getting so incredibly sick and tired of subscription streaming services like Disney+ and the like. It feels like we've just come full circle back to cable and blockbuster. The whole point of digital streaming was to make it cheaper and easier to access movies and television, emphasis on cheaper. Now you have to subscribe to 3 different streaming services just to be able to watch all of the movies from your childhood, and some streaming services don't even guarantee that you get the movie (looking at you Prime Video).\n\nIt all just feels like a scam. And I don't believe a single person that says this is healthy for the industry and says that it puts more money in the hands of artists, because we all know it doesn't. It's just a way for these greedy studios to squeeze as much money from you as they can, regardless of their public image, and put more money into the hands of execs and figureheads. They're \"too big to fail\" because they have people who support every decision they make regardless of how it affects them. I just want to see these companies taken down a peg. Remind them that they would be nothing without their employees or their fanbase.\n\n(Edit) The amount of people defending these studios for charging $15-20 a month when they were just fine licensing their media to netflix is astonishing.",

        "title": "A Ranking of the Entire Riddick/Pitch Black franchise - A Short Review per Entry.",
        "selftext": "Genuinely ever since I've seen Pitch Black on TV a couple years after it came out, and shortly after I played Escape from Butcher Bay, every couple years or so I do a Riddick Marathon where I set about beating the games, watching the movies, and check out the side media again. I'm not like a MASSIVE fan of this series or anything, but I am a big enough fan to replay some games I love, and watch some old nostalgic movies relatively often. I know it's not a ground breaking franchise, and I know a lot of people think both it and/or Vin diesel isn't that great. But I gotta say, If you like Sci-fi I personally think all of it is worth a try. With that being said, here's a fans ranking of what's Best to Worst, split into the good and the not so good:\n\n**The Good:**\n\n**#1. Pitch Black.** *(Movie 1, Chronologically the third Chapter of the series atm)* It's an underrated masterpiece and one of the best Sci-Fi movies within 2-3 years of either side of it (Obviously barring the Matrix 1, lol). The way it ends on you not really knowing if Riddick is the good guy, or the bad guy is amazing and pretty much every entry in the series sort of sullies how astonishing Pitch Black is for its budget and how understated the Sci-Fi and horror elements are in the overall plot of it. It's a lot like a late 1990's version of Alien, plus Riddick's there, lol. Absolutely amazing movie. Albeit with some weird editing choices at times, that can for sure be overlooked. Virtually everything in the series after this focus's really hard on making Riddick look bad ass, because he was just badass in this, seemingly without even trying, and then, I'm not going to lie, in everything after this it does feel like they get progressively a bit more tryhard-ish making him look cool. Still love the series, but to me it does feel like that, and like this movie is almost a stand-alone film to rest of the series. A real must watch Sci-fi IMO and I personally hold this movie on a super high pedestal. Even Dark Fury, which I highly praise, is a fair bit below this in my standings even though it's the second best entry in the series in my opinion.\n\n**#2 Dark Fury.** *(OVA/Short Animation 1, Chronologically the fourth Chapter of the series atm)* This one's the real bridge gapper in the series, unlike some other side media that is meant to bridge a gap in the series. The Furyian stuff is present in this one, but nothing like in Chronicles. I'll admit, before saying what I'll say next, that the early 2000's 3D animation they used in some parts does suck (minus the color monsters like half way through the movie, those fuckers are cool as shit even in early 2000's 3D, great use of colors in that part). But, with that being said, this shit looks amazing. In comparison, this is gunna sound weird lmfao, I think this looks like a combination of Baki the Grappler's art style, with Jacki Chan adventure's lmfao. Sometimes the faces, specifically Riddick, are way over detailed, like in some Baki shots lol, but it's always in this sort of classic western anime art style that looks like Jackie Chan Adventures (or even the old Men In Black Anime/Cartoon LOL) on steroids, if you get what I mean. Anyways, what I mean by this being the real bridge gapper is that this one feels both like Pitch Black, and the Chronicles, and the design of some of the stuff too really fits well into the games also. This is the one piece of Riddick media that fits well with all the rest somehow, and I really like it. Maybe it's because it's an anime that I think it all works really well together, like I mention below that Chronicles would fit better as a game, this one just works so well as an anime and fits so damn well into the series to boot. I also love the bad guys in this one, unique motive from the rest of the series and cool designs. But yeah, this one is super stylish and one of the best entries in the series.\n\n**#3 Assault on Dark Athena.** *(Game 2, Chronologically the second Chapter of the series atm)* Amazing stealth-action-narrative game, and for the time of it's release it's super impressive in terms of lighting and cinematics. The same can be said about the first game, but this one refined so much, and the level design and story are much better, with a lot less load screens. I'd say personally between the games and Dark Fury, it's the closest we see Riddick as he was in Pitch Black... And in my personal opinion the stories in this and the first game are a lot more like Pitch Black and Dark Fury than the Chronicles and they're far better since they don't really have anything to do with the Necromongers, or his Furyian roots, which I think are two of the weaker aspects to the series. Totally worth playing if you really like this series, even if your not into video games, since it's only about 6 hours long and is cutscene heavy.\n\n**#4 Escape from Butcher Bay.** *(Game 1, Chronologically the start of the series atm)* Like the second game it's an amazing stealth-action-narrative game, and for the time of it's release it's even more impressive in terms of lighting and cinematics, since it came out on the original Xbox. But anyways, this game is pretty good too, but I feel like the story and gameplay are a little weaker. There's a lot more friction in this game too, more frustrating parts, a little bit of confusing level design here and there, a lot more loading screens, and it's just in general a little less satisfying experience than Assault on Dark Athena, that being said, I love the amount of interaction you get with Johns in this game, as he's my other favorite character in the series other than Riddick himself. I also love that Butcher Bay is explicitly mentioned in the Chronicles, meaning this game is referenced to in both Pitch Black and the Chronicles, which as far as I can remember Assault on Dark Athena only ever references the movies, the movies never reference its events like they do Butcher Bay's. It just adds something to both the game and the movies when you hear the references. All in all still a great game and well worth the 6-ish hours it takes to get through too, and it's still one of the best entries in the series even with all the friction I mentioned.\n\n**#5 Riddick.** *(Movie 3, Chronologically the sixth Chapter of the series atm)* This one is kind of only marred by the fact that it's a sequel to Chronicles. The first 25 minutes and the last 5 minutes are time solely dedicated to following up the Chronicles story and I feel like these parts are really weak. While the rest of, and a majority of the movie is a self contained story, that feels far more like a sequel to Pitch Black than to the Chronicles, and I'm here for it, and it's so much better for it. They take the premise of the first movie, switch some stuff around, change the characters up, and make Riddick more of a threat to the main group, but sadly replace the ending that left you guessing in the Pitch Black, with a more \"satisfying\" one where the deuteragonist and Riddick see eye to eye and actually do help one another, for a more \"feel good\" ending if you get what I mean. It's not bad, it's just not as good or memorable is all I'm saying. And I still don't think it's as good as Pitch Black or Dark Fury at all, but this one really is a good follow up, whether you liked Pitch Black or Chronicles. The ending that happens after the ending... The last 5 minutes with the Necromonger storyline is kinda wonky though, setting up for another chapter set around the Nercomongers, the Underverse, and Vaako. Which I thought was the weakest chapter in the series so far, and it seemed like even this movie wanted to remove itself from Chronicles with how it all \"resets to zero\" at the start and then pretty much dive into an entirely different movie that sequels the first movie instead of the second. In all honesty I think I may even say this movie is better than the games if the Necromonger stuff and everything referencing Chronicles was removed. It would feel like another loosely tied in story to Riddicks long and storied past, a nice follow up to just Pitch Black.\n\n**The Not So Good:**\n\n**#6 The Chronicles. (Directors Cut).** *(Movie 2, Chronologically the fifth Chapter of the series atm)* This one I'm mixed on so it's gunna be longer. As I mentioned I only watch the Directors Cut because the Theatrical, and Netflix Cuts just aren't as good, period. I think the best parts of the movie take place at the start and middle though. The mercs hunting Riddick, and then the prison lockup and escape. These to me are the parts that are a lot more of what I like about the Riddick series, and I like that they connect to Dark Fury. These parts still aren't perfect though, and feel like a country mile from the style and understatement of it all we got in Pitch Black. But those parts, to me, do still make it feel like a Riddick movie. That being said, I kinda hate the Necromongers, how it got turned into a pseudo-space opera, and how much fantasy was incorporated into this movie, with things like the race of Elementals, and the Underverse being a real place that exists outside our universe, and through its powers you can literally pull someone's soul out... And how it ends too... Those things were just too far gone from Pitch Black, or even the games for me to like at all, and I also really didn't enjoy how much they got into Riddick's roots, and how overplayed the Furyian stuff is. The Furyian stuff pretty much goes 0 to 100 in this movie. The whole series goes from 0 to 100 so fast in this movie if you've only ever watched Pitch Black before it too, which was most peoples experience when this movie first came out. Anyways, about the Furyian stuff, I liked it better when Riddick was a dark mysterious killer who we only knew had a long and storied passed throughout multiple galaxies seemingly (As he is in Pitch Black, the Games, and Dark Fury). But them getting this deep with him and making him like, a chosen one, survivor, vision seer, messiah, kinda thing, last of his race, in Chronicles is just a huge leap from Pitch Black or the games, or even Dark Fury that I just don't get why they went there really. Anyways, it's still a fun watch. My main gripes with it is how far separated from the rest of the series this one seemed, where Pitch Black is so good it almost seems stand alone, this one isn't necessarily so bad it seems stand alone... It's just so far removed from Pitch Black, which I adore, that it seems stand alone to the series since almost everything else shoots for feeling kinda like Pitch Black. Even the Riddick movie which is Chronicles direct sequel only spends like 15 of the first 25 minutes removing itself from Chronicles and then becomes an entirely different movie more like the rest of the series, if not more like Pitch Black itself. Like if you skip the start of Riddick and jump to the 23/24 minute mark where he says \"it resets to zero\" then really Chronicles would have almost nothing to do with the rest of the series barring being the return of Jack. So for that I think this is the weakest movie in the series even if it's the most well known. And I also want to put it out there that this seems like a story that would be better served in one of the games. The Necromongers, Vaako, and the Lord Marshal all seem like way cooler video game enemies than Riddick movie bad guys, plus the race of Elementals and stuff fits better into something like a video game too; I think; Rather than a series of movies that started off as understated as Pitch Black. (Also, last point here, just wanna mention, oh my god, Thandi Newton looks so damn good in this movie, if there's any reason this movie is superb amongst the rest of the series, it's Thandi Newton.)\n\n**#7 Slam City.** *(Motion Comic 1, Originally this Chronologically shared being the first Chapter of the series with Into Pitch Black, But is no longer cannon to the main Chronology)* Quick and dirty animation, with no voice over, so you gotta read it, explaining how Riddick got his eyes and a couple other things leading into Pitch Black, but not really how he got his eyes, or how things lead into Pitch Black. Worth a watch/viewing if you really don't wanna play the games to find out how he got his eyes and a few other things, since this isn't THAT far off. But really the games are worth 6 hours of your time more than this is worth 20 mins of your time and the real way he gets his eyes IS different canonically now. It's just not THAT different so if you want you CAN read/watch this instead of playing the games.\n\n**#8 Blindsided** *(Motion Comic 2, Originally this was Chronologically the sixth Chapter of the series, But is no longer cannon to the main Chronology)* Quick and dirty animation that's almost a publicly released storyboard for a flash back within the first 20 minutes of the Riddick movie explaining why the series is set back from the Necromonger space opera we got, and Chronicles ending the way it did, to how we're now at a more localized and self contained story about Riddick searching for Furya, without most of the Necromonger plot inconveniences. At like 6 minutes of run time, even if you really like the series, it's still not really worth watching before Riddick since the events in this take place in that, with some cannon changes. And largely the explanation is kinda dumb anyways, it's just Riddick VO'ing that he got bored as Lord Marshal and after an attack on his life he leaves Vaako as the commanding officer, on bad terms to search for Furya. So if you did wanna skip this in lieu of the movies summary, you could and wont miss out on anything since that movie covers this.\n\n**#9 Into Pitch Black.** *(Short Film/Television Special 1, Originally this was Chronologically the third Chapter of the series, as well as shared being the first Chapter of the series with Slam City, and second chapter with Pitch Black \\[it covers before, during, and after the events of Pitch Black\\], But is no longer cannon to the main Chronology)* IMO It feels like a fan or student film that isn't done well. The actors aren't very good, and the story itself isn't very interesting, and the cinematography and editing is nausea inducing. I mentioned before that Pitch Black has some weird editing. But you wont believe this short film. Essentially it's about an investigation into the crash that happens at the start of Pitch Black and Riddick himself since he was lost in the crash. It's really not worth watching in my opinion. The two good things about this movie are the total babe that plays the merc, and the footage from Pitch Black. You gotta really love the series to check this one out all the way through IMO.\n\n**#10 The Merc Files.** *(Third game, largely negligible to the chronology of the series)* This game is entirely different than the original 2 games, as its a touch screen, mobile game. Largely negligible story, not very good gameplay. Don't bother, even if you like the series.",

Because it is uncanny - down the the way his mouth moves and the twinkle he gets in his eye. If I’m seeing things please tell me but I needed a sounding board to know if others have the same thought. Also, can we get a biopic starring AG, please?",

        "selftext": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/here_2024): 23% (from 13 reviews) with 5.40 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/here-2024/): 46/100 (7 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n> Zemeckis for years now has been fixated on technology and its visual capabilities, to the point where he neglects the rudiments of story and character development. The vignettes here return frequently to the same families at different moments in their lives, but rarely settle in for long enough to sustain narrative momentum or give the characters much depth.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/here-review-tom-hanks-robin-wright-robert-zemeckis-1236045912/)\n\n> From “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” to “The Polar Express,” Zemeckis’ superpower has always been his pioneering spirit, while his kryptonite is a penchant for unearned sentimentality. “Here” fits that pattern to a tee, as Zemeckis dedicates his energy not to crafting fully dimensional characters, but to advancing the sort of “digital makeup” Martin Scorsese used to youthen the cast of “The Irishman,” effectively draining the project of the very thing he set out to celebrate: life.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/here-review-tom-hanks-robin-wright-1236191061/)\n\n> If you’ve ever passed through or lived in a house and wondered who was there before you — whether Paul Bettany as a cranky boozer, Kelly Reilly as a stroke victim in a wheelchair, or Tom Hanks and Robin Wright as lovers who can’t seem to make it work but sure tried — “Here” will resonate. But if you have no curiosity, then there’s nothing, not a thing, ultimately here for you.\n\n-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/here-movie-review-robert-zemeckis-1235060293/): B\n\n> Robert Zemeckis reunites with the crew and (horribly de-aged) cast of Forrest Gump to turn a formally audacious comic into a visually lackadaisical film. Here tells the story of one family's living room from a single camera angle, which it attempts to transform into nostalgic sentiment about American history. But these self-imposed limitations yield no creative solutions, and with one hand tied behind its back, Here can merely gesture towards the ugliness and complexity of the culture it portrays.\n\n-[Siddhant Adlakha, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/here-review-tom-hanks-robert-zemeckis-robin-wright): 5/10 \"mediocre\"\n\n> Here is a noble experiment, and a welcome dose of originality in a year full of sequels, even if it doesn’t quite work on every level. For me, I tried mightily to resist its emotional pull, but by the end I finally surrendered to it and shed more than one tear in thinking about our ever-changing place on this earth and how we have to somehow hold on to what is good in this life, even in the darkest of times.\n\n-[Pete Hammond, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/10/here-review-forrest-gump-filmmaker-robert-zemeckis-reunites-tom-hanks-amp-robin-wright-1236159155/)\n\n> The de-ageing techniques used to make Hanks and Wright appear younger are skillfully executed, and the actors manage to create some achingly tender moments. But Zemeckis, as is often the case, cannot resist overdoing potentially poignant moments with cutesy flourishes or by amplifying Alan Silvestri’s string-laden score. The characters’ lack of definition may help them resonate with audiences, who will project their own fears about mortality, loss and failure onto these somewhat blank individuals. But while Zemeckis taps into something powerful about our desire to make our time here on Earth count, it’s bitterly ironic that what his film most needs is, in fact, more time — so we can understand these people better and give their universal anxieties and dreams more resonance.\n\n-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/here-review/5198543.article)\n\n> Like watching Madame Tussaud’s mannequins in a community theater play, Here becomes more tiresome as it draws closer to its inevitable everybody-moves-out finale, and Zemeckis’ few socio-political nods — Bettany’s military veteran grumbling that no one thanked him for his service; Black parents schooling their son on the precise way to handle being pulled over by the cops — are simply empty gestures.\n\n-[Nick Schager, The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/here-review-tom-hanks-forrest-gump-reunion-is-an-embarrassment/)\n\n> In many ways, Here is an experiment in framing and concept that fails. And yet, I'm in awe that Zemeckis did it. Even with the movie's rough edges, his passion and sentimentality is as clear as ever.\n\n-[Kristy Puchko, Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/here-tom-hanks-review?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nThe story covers the events of a single spot of land and its inhabitants, spanning from the past to well into the future.\n\n**DIRECTOR** \n\nRobert Zemeckis\n\n**WRITER**\n\nEric Roth & Robert Zemeckis (based on the graphic novel by Richard McGuire)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nDon Burgess\n\n**EDITOR**\n\nJesse Goldsmith\n\n**RELEASE DATE** \n\n- October 25, 2024 (AFI Fest)\n\n- November 1, 2024 (theaters)\n\n**RUNTIME**\n\n104 minutes\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n$80 million\n\n**STARRING**\n\n- Tom Hanks as Richard Young\n\n- Robin Wright as Margaret\n\n- Paul Bettany as Al Young\n\n- Kelly Reilly as Rose Young\n\n- Michelle Dockery as Mrs Harter\n\n- Gwilym Lee as John Harter",

        "selftext": "We frequently wish to see some of our favorite books turned into movies. How about the other way around? Each medium has its strengths and I feel the way books can go into lore/background of a world and get into the heads of the characters, no other medium can.\n\nFor this reason and to offer examples, I would really like to see (even though they will never happen but still) book adaptations of:\n\n1) Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. I think the movies have interesting lore but focus on Jack Sparrow only with some tidbits sprinkled in. However, if a hypothetical book adaptation is done, you can get deep into the back story of Sparrow, Davy Jones, the larger magic/fantasy elements at play. And also to get to see how other pirates operate in that world. It could be a very fun way to explore that world.\n\n2) A novelization of 'Knives Out' would be fantastic. Benoit Blanc is one of the most fun characters to come out of movies in recent times. It would be nice to get inside his head and see how he looks at things and tries to solve his mysteries. In the movies you get the idea that he is a bit straightforward. But there is a lot going on inside. \n\nAre there examples of movies that can serve as great book adaptations?",

Looking at the list of previous winners I found that I had only actually seen about 13, so I started a journey of watching every movie to ever win the award in order, where watching one about every 2 weeks would bring me right up to the 100th Oscars Ceremony. Last night I got to the 12th movie on the list, Gone with the Wind, which I had never seen before but had obviously heard a lot about. I have to say, I was actually blown away by how good it was. For a 4 hour movie I expected it to drag a lot, but I found myself hooked from start to finish. Every technical facet feels miles above its predecessors, the characters are complex and compelling despite largely being awful people, and even though it’s heavily romanticized, I was completely enthralled by its depiction of the old south. Turns out I might be a sucker for historical epics. I wanted to see if anyone else thought this movie lived up to the hype, or hear what parts didn’t work for you. I’d also be happy to discuss the other movies I’ve watched thus far as well. Next up is Rebecca, which might actually be my first Hitchcock movie, so I’m quite excited for that. ",

It wasn't character driven at all and they were poorly developed.\n4. the writing was not good; that is not what gay sex is like at all.\n5. because i didn't relate to or sympathize with the poorly developed characters, the payoff at the end felt unearned.\n\nWhy does everyone love this movie? It isn't good. The only bad review I found was some guy saying he doesn't like how all gay movies have to be tragedies, which I don't mind. I like tragic movies, they give better catharsis. But this was just poorly written. I can't be the only person to feel this way?\n\n  \nEDIT\n\nthis imdb comment summed up my opinion pretty well.\n\n\"I'm in a tiny minority, but I was so disappointed with Brokeback Mountain. I suspect in a few years time people will wonder why it won so many awards - maybe it was just a movie of its time. There is no empathy with the central characters, the falling in love is sudden and brutal, and the pacing throughout was incredibly ponderous. And, for a poor Englishman, trying to understand the muttering dialogue was a real challenge. It was completely cold throughout - none of the characters mattered, nor did their fate stir the slightest emotion. One scene slipped into the next, endlessly, as the movie meandered its way towards a finish. And, boy, did it meander! It seemed to take forever. This movie felt every second of its 2 hours and 15 minutes. Avoid.\"",

But lately i see reviews of really big movies that i've never heard of, the most recent case is the new Venom that i just knew about from a YouTube recommended review. Back in the day i remember turning up the TV and see some thing to promote the movie, but now it seems to be lacking it, and a lot; if the major names aren't showing to me - i cannot imagine how many small amazing movies i didnt heard about.\n\nSorry for the bad english or confusing text.",

        "selftext": "I watched the movie Don't Move and for the most part thought it was well done, I enjoyed it. But when I checked to see how many minutes were still left and I saw the end was nearing I was afraid it would be a bad scene, and sure enough it was. She clearly was going to get the upper hand, but the way it was done really ruined it for me. \n\nHer hands were tied with the tie rips, yet she managed to get a hold of that knife and took him by surprise, maybe it was the way it was filmed or acted but that scene was ridiculous. It felt very off to me. I definitely wanted her to win, but this felt so cheap. It honestly would have been better if she had somehow rocked the boat and he fell into the water or something, still a bit dumb but more believable than this. I had to rewind the scene to see if I was missing something. I don't think he was even close enough to her for her to be able to grab the knife, sigh. \n\nOther scenes I thought were odd was how she managed to grab the syringe, when and how? The seat belt I can kinda believe since it's so close to her, but the syringe? Or did she grab it when the psycho was killing the cop? Yeah it's probably that. I guess she'd have enough time then. Still, the psycho didn't see the syringe missing, interesting. \n\nThe other scene was earlier when the psycho was about to leave by car and decided he'd go back and get her, so he was aware she was behind the couch after all? To me it seemed he heard the finger taps but then saw nothing and left. More logical would be that he knew she was there and decided to \"rescue\" her after all. \n\nSo I'm not entirely sure if those are \"bad\" scenes perse, but her escape, so to speak, weak as hell.

        "title": "Cult Indoctrination Tactics, Midsommar, and A Discrepancy in Motives - Who The Hell Is Orchestrating This Whole Thing? ",
        "selftext": "\n*Alternatively Titled \"Traumatized? Join A Death Cult About It!\" \n\n\n\nThis is disorganized as hell, and for that, I apologize. \n\nWhen I first watched this movie upon its release in theatres, obviously, I had no idea what sort of fever dream I was signing up for. Furthermore, I was in a pretty confusing place in my life, and I remember seeing the scene where Dani is crying and a group of women are seated across her, mirroring her intensity of emotion, and thinking, \"wow, this is exactly what she never got from her boyfriend - emotional availability or reciprocation.\" I have done a lot of introspection and also worked with someone since then; I resolved a lot of the shit that happened to me that I realized I had not gotten over (I will skip the fact that Midsommar sent me to therapy for the sake of saving time, and for my own dignity.. although evidently, not entirely.) Of course I recognized that this all was happening in a very unhealthy manner, but still. \n\n\nUpon my second viewing, to my bewilderment, I found my opinions of the events in the movie changing less than I thought they would. This is because no matter how hard I try, I simply cannot come up with a plausible reason as to why Pelle invited them with malicious intent, and I truly believe that at least some of the members who were born into the cult are sincerely devoted to it. In short: this is a tragedy(?) without a clear villain. \n\n\nAddressing the first - Pelle does initially acknowledge that Dani's parents were killed tragically, which he apologizes for bringing up immediately afterwards. This does seem like a tactic a manipulator would use to place someone in an emotionally vulnerable place and then immediately deflecting responsibility for it to use it to their advantage. However, how would Pelle have known about this previously? This is.. a very risky dice roll. Is he just banking on the fact that someone will inevitably have unresolved baggage that he can prey on? I am seriously looking for answers. \n\nFor my second point - I think the fact that not all of the members are in on the manipulation (or rather, they are not told 100% of the truth - it is unclear whether this is by omission or outright deception) is most noticeable in the ending scene where Ingemar realizes he had been lied to about the extract he was given, and that he indeed would be feeling it the entire time he was dying. Aside from this, we watch two of the elders literally fling themselves off of a cliff. If that's not devotion, it's a pretty long fucking con, at least, so please explain that to me if that's the case, lol.   \n\nDespite this, there is obviously something insiduous going on. Guests are disappearing one by one - but why? What is the point? Did they invite Dani here to integrate some Americans into their cult in order to diversify their genetic variation? If yes, why did they kill everyone else? Doesn't seem very cost-efficient :P (*see below for notes.) Why not more locals? Am I completely misunderstanding this whole thing? Genuinely perplexing. \n\nSo here is what I think based on these two things: Dani has obviously not recovered from the position she was put in with her sister. Her sister is clearly very mentally ill and Dani acts as a sort of makeshift deescelator for her, even though she is clearly not a professional, or even in a good place herself to support her sister without giving something of herself. The death of her sister and her parents destabilizes her even further, and she relies on Christian for support and it's still unclear to me that if she's overstepping or not since we don't have that much context of their relationship previously. Regardless of this, Christian probably should have ended the relationship a long time ago; he is simply not emotionally available to maintain their relationship (he blatantly shows disinterest in her at the beginning of the movie, which I think is confirmed when Dani is implied to know about this) let alone support her through the aftermath of a tragedy; however, he is also not willing to break up with her after something like this (which is also understandable in my opinion. I have also made the mistake of not ending a relationship when I should have, and if the person had lost their family in such a tragic accident during that time, would I have done anything differently? I am genuinely not sure. I'm just saying it's a very delicate place to leave someone.) Christian is kind of shitty, in an emotionally detached 20-something-year-old I-still-haven't-figured-this-shit-out sort of way, but he's not evil, and he sure as hell isn't the villain of this movie either. \n\nPelle invites them, supposedly having already extended the invitiation to one of the grad students, and then shifts his focus to Dani which is implied by Pelle flirting with her now and then throughout the movie, perhaps truly believing in the ideology or with some other motive in mind. It doesn't matter, I think, because this cult is likely comprised of at least one person who truly believes in the ideology (who would they be manipulating otherwise?) Dani happens to be in an emotionally vulnerable place and is the perfect target to be love-bombed into a death cult that actually seems to give a shit about her feelings and her emotions. I think this is both a good and a bad thing - ultimately bad, ‘cause yknow, death cult, but she does end up getting the support and even a modicum of emotional connection that she so desperately sought from Christian. I personally don't think that this is unrealistic, since she the general vibe I got was that Christian was not showing empathy towards her at all. (The scene in which Dani is absolutely losing her shit on her couch while Christian half-assedly holds her makes this very clear in my opinion. The lights are on, but no one's home, so to say.) However, it is important to note that Christian does these things because he himself is having qualms about the situation and is not entirely callous in his intention. \n\nDani does not recognize these dynamics because she is not mentally in a good place. (Hell, even I, as the viewer, got kind of roped into it the first time I watched it. It was an absolute even I, as the viewer, got kind of roped into it the first time I watched it. It was an absolute deliriant of a movie, but what a delirium that was!) However, this also means that she distrusts her friends to the same degree at some point- it's a very delicate balance of the cult members ensuring that she feels more supported in the cult than she did with her friends. Essentially, they want to replace her family, either noticing the makeshift one isn't cutting it or simply outdoing them by default. I feel like the former is not the case: the odds of that working out are.. quite unlikely? The thing that I'm trying to get at here is that I don't understand what the motive of the cult is, or even if there is a party that's to blame in this movie, rather than it all just being a series of shitty happenstances. \n\nThis would be a solid argument if the other guests didn't keep dying. I cannot explain this - is it supposed to be a more abstract allegory for desecration/disrespect of the sacred? If not, why the hell is the cult murdering them?! \n\nThe movie is horrifying because Aster uses cult indoctrination tactics on the viewer exactly as Dani is experiencing them; for a second, let's assign that as the motive here. In this effort, Aster is the manipulator, so to say, the movie is the medium, and the victim is the viewer. In a different vein, can the manipulator and the medium both be the cult in this movie? The manipulator must have two facets: one that holds the true motive at heart, and one that identifies with the motive that will be presented to others to manipulate them. What is the cult truly gaining from this? Is it simply an altruistic act of ensuring the legacy of itself? Is the manipulator simply a concept, using ALL of the cult members to perpetuate itself? **If this is the case, how is that different from any other philosophy that survives beyond the average human's lifetime due to lateral/horizontal cultural transfer?** Is the problem, at its core, the blurring of the boundaries between the self and the community? At first, it seems fair to say that if you are allowed to share your grief and pain, you should share other aspects of yourself that are also beneficial to you as a person. I guess this could also mean that Aster is arguing that grief and pain, ultimately, are beneficial to the human psyche, as it allows for the rarification of the self through one's own experiences. \n\nOf course, it could also just simply be considered as a juxtaposition element, since the cult is a stark contrast to modern daily life, where people usually do not get to choose how or when they die....... \n\nlet me know if you have thoughts! i’m not asserting I am right by any means and have probably missed a myriad of nuances. and if you read this far, thank you :P\n\n\nETA: There’s also something to be said about how Christian mentions that pelle invited them to their “swedish yodeling village” (I am not even Swiss, I am only half-austrian and even I cringed at this. :P) This could all be seen as a matter of having certain expectations and then being horrified that this unknown and foreign (but more importantly, not necessarily evil, or even in possession of a moral alignment close to the viewer’s) didn’t turn out to be their “Swedish Coachella,” - I forgot who said that, but still. In that case, there is an objective reality in the most concrete sense, but there is no way to judge this. I guess I’d be better off watching this, shrugging it off as “well, I guess that happened” and leaving it at that. \n\n*Probably makes the cult members nervous, too. Unless there's a certain number of corpses that is deemed acceptable in the commune. Additionally, how are you gonna explain all that shit to the families of the missing? What about the government? Will their Swedish visas not run out?! This is a bureaucratic disaster :P",

No invented stories, no invented characters, real people. \n\nThere were a few key moments that could qualify as deppresing throughout the movie, more specifically the second plane crash footage, the hijacking scene and the phone calls.  What really stuck with me until today is the final scene. The passengers revolt against the terrorists. It happens very quickly, but not quietly and the violence and each piece of effort of the passengers to kill Al Nami and Al Haznawi could be felt.  While watching this I wasn't just nervous. I was anxious, trembling and with tears in my eyes, praying that the passengers of United 93 would reach the cockpit in time and take over the controls. \n\nThe final minute of the revolt was utterly deppresing. The passengers break into the cockpit just as Ziad Jarrah pulls the plane down. the screams, the agony in this scene.  The passengers using every last bit of their strength trying to pull the plane up,  but it was just too late.

Unfortunately, it was a major let down, to the point of it causing me secondhand embasement for the film. \n\nThe acting by Josh Hartnett was cliché & overplayed. \n\n It was extremely unbelievable (even for a movie), I could make an entire seperate post giving examples. For instance, letting a serial killer stop & hug his children after he's captured, & then proceed to bend down & somehow break a spoke from a bicycle & slip it up his sleeve while handcuffed, shackled, & surrounded by dozens of SWAT members & police officers. \n\nShyamalan is known for his epic twists. The biggest twist was when his wife turned him in for being the \"Butcher\" & (predictably) poisoning his food. \n\nIt definitely felt as if this film was rushed. He had two movies - both MAX originals, both released this year. He likely had a contract with MAX to put out a number of films using Shyamalan's name to entice subscribers rather than a decent film. Also, it seems as though the film centered on promoting his daughters singing & acting career.\n\nHaven't seen a movie this bad in awhile.\n\nEdit: spelling. ",

I’d love some recommendations of movies that contain children or are driven by children’s actions that lead to tragic happenings or the like. Movies like The good son, atonement and the hunt. Although horror/thriller movies like the omen, orphan and we need to talk about kevin are part of this category as well but i’d prefer something more akin to the first three. Ive seen a lot that fit this genre but i’d love some new recommendations, it recently came up in a conversation with a friend that wanted more of this type of movies and i was stomped. Thanks in advance.\n\nEdit: My sincerest thanks for all the suggestions, I am looking into each and everyone ❤️❤️",

        "selftext": "I say this because damn they could have kept playing high school and college-aged well into the mid/late-90’s. You look at the cast playing high schoolers in Twin Peaks, all around the same age, some even a little older. You look at Scream. Half of the cast is only a year or two older than them. Hell in SLC Punk which came out in 1998, it’s implied that Matthew Lillard’s character is fresh out of high school, and he’s than two years younger than them. There are plenty more that come to mind. Brendan Fraser, Michael Rappaport, Ben Affleck, Kristy Swanson, etc.\n\nI think the obvious answer is just audience burnout with them from the 80’s, but still, it’s quite sad. They had a lot more to give in what was still their prime. I’m glad to see them getting more work in the last decade or so, even if some of it is based off of nostalgia (Ringwald in Riverdale comes to mind).\n\nThe flipside of this is fuckin Craig Sheffer who was somehow still able to get himself cast as a college student at 33 in The Program.",

Movies like *The Paw Patrol Movie* are specifically designed for kids only. This post is mainly about *Paw Patrol,* but I find it funny that adults will call *Paw Patrol* bad and give it this in-depth review like it's a Pixar movie or something. *Paw Patrol* is a kids' movie meant for kids; it’s not supposed to be enjoyed by adults.\n\nThere’s a reason Chris Stuckmann, Jeremy Jahns, Cody Leach, Adam Does Movies, etc., didn’t review the *Paw Patrol* movies or any movie specifically made for toddlers—they understand they can’t really give a fair review. Those are grown adults; obviously, they’re going to cringe watching a movie or show meant for small children. Who would they be writing this review for? No adult without kids is going out of their way to watch *Bluey* or *Paw Patrol.* Do the children like *Paw Patrol*? If the answer is yes, then that’s what matters. *Paw Patrol* isn’t for us adults to review and critique.\n\nInstead of us reviewing and calling *Paw Patrol* \"bad\" and trying to critique it, let's watch movies that were made for us—movies like *Dune,* *Oppenheimer,* *Twisters,* *The Fall Guy,* *Planet of the Apes,* *Alien: Romulus,* etc. Let the kids be kids and let them enjoy *Paw Patrol* until they get too old for it and move on to live-action Nickelodeon and Disney Channel movies.",

Unfortunately, the status of only one or two titles was changed, and recently, the Video told me to stop bothering them anymore and that I was rushing too much.\n\nI mean, excuse me. The Video is shamelessly carrying out-of-print and rarer titles, especially ones whose copies, new and used/pre-owned, have gotten expensive on Amazon—just third-party sellers on Amazon, not the seller \"Amazon.com\" itself—and eBay. After all I tried to do for the Video, the Video had a nerve to say that I was wasting their time and unwilling to \"listen\" to them. Outraged, I told the Video that I hope it fails ASAP. \n\nHonestly, I would never sign up for any non-Netflix rent-by-mail service, like Scarecrow Video. (Speaking of Netflix, Netflix stopped its rent-by-mail service last year.) Chances are: a legit copy of a rarer title, like ones containing *actual* (not fictional) sports tournaments, would get lost or damaged in some way or another. Also, selected catalog is either kinda lame (if just popular titles or generic ones in popular genres) or outrageous and risky (if rarer titles are included).\n\nAlso, if I establish a video rental store, I'd never start or run a rent-by-mail service... ever! Well, I thought about doing a rent-by-mail service, but then as I figured, the declining physical home media market, the risk factors, and rising streaming market make rent-by-mail.... outdated and too risky anymore, especially for independent video rental stores, like Scarecrow Video, despite holding large library catalog.\n\nIf I wanna watch a rarer title, I'd rather do an in-store visit method or buy a used copy on eBay instead.",

        "selftext": "Typically, dystopian movies focus on the dystopia. *Brazil*, *1984*, *Equilibrium,* etc. all make the dystopia a part of the main plot, often with the protagonist either being caught up in the dystopia or the fighting against it.\n\n*Minority Report* does it differently. The main plot of the movie is more of a murder mystery action flick. Anderton is falsely accused of a crime, and he has to fight the system to clear his name. The main conflict theme of the movie is a debate between predestination and free will. That on it its own makes for a fine movie.\n\nHowever, lurking underneath this plot is the authoritarian and dystopian nightmare that the future has become. They all take place in the background. These are some of the dystopian elements:\n\n* The precogs are essentially slaves and \"it's best not to think of them as human.\" However, the lie is spun to the public that the precogs are happy and comfortable.\n* Those convicted of murder do not appear to get any trial or due process. Even beyond the whole element of being convicted of crime they did not commit, they seem to get arrested and then go straight to prison.\n* Prisons are replaced with mind control chambers were the offender relives the murder over and over again. It's a nightmare chamber.\n* Society seems to have been overcome with neuroin addiction.\n* The police are highly militarized. They wear full body armour and fly around in jets.\n* Many civil rights seem to be non-existent. For example, the police search the apartment complex with the spiders without any sign of a warrant. The people getting search seemed to fully accept the reality that a mechanical spider can crawl up on them at any time.\n* People have ocular implants which can monitor their position.\n* Advertising if fully invasive, in part due to the ocular implant.\n* They make it sound like the halo that the police use to subdue suspects is a comparable to a torture device. People seem absolutely terrified of the halo.\n* The government was running secret medical experiments on kids born as neuroin addicts.\n* When arresting people of crimes, the police do not seem to care at all for the victims. They arrest the suspect, but no emergency service tends to the victim, such as a paramedic. It's as though they only care about order, not safety.\n* It sounds like a significant amount of people live in \"government blocks,\" which suggests a combination of poverty and government control.\n\nI'm sure there are more, but that's all that comes to mind right now.\n\nWhat is great is that there isn't too much focus on these elements. They happen in the background and make you double take. Everyone in the movie just seems to accept these elements and have resigned themselves to the dystopia. When John Anderton clears his name and Pre-Crime shuts down, Anderton presumably returns to work as a police officer, imprisoning people without trial, confining them to nightmare chambers, but doing it the old fashioned way. It's a \"happy ending,\" because now the pre-cogs are free, but the rest of society is still a nightmare.\n\nThat's what I like about this movie the most. Not focusing on the dystopian elements allows them linger in our minds as we watch the movie. You can always catch something new with each re-watch.",

        "selftext": "Just finished watching The Menu which has been on my list for a while and had a few thoughts about how it all ended. Was the ending implied to be:\n\n1. A Magnum Opus in menu design by a jaded master artist, who’s gradual dismantling of his own passion combines a personal vendetta with food relevant to his message, in one last malevolent display of his superior skill and design.\n\n2. A blatant expression of revenge fuelled by years of depreciation of the art form he’d built his life around.\n\nI really liked this film and I feel there’s a lot to unpack with regards to hidden meaning and commentaries on various topics around the service industry and societal groups and backgrounds.",

Gonna be getting a happy buzz and want to enhance through film.  Last time I chose a couple movies for this I went for Avatar 2 and Arrival...which were perfect.  While I love sci-fi, it is not my be all end all.  Open to recommendations all over the place.\n\nI was thinking about running Justice League Snyder Cut on the 4k Blu-ray, but I've watched it so many times.  I would be forever grateful for your thoughts\n\nEdit: ended up watching The Wild Robot and it blew me away.  I don't know what to even say, some people just got it.  Aces ",
