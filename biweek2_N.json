I feel upset because 1.they made all that built up completely pointless, and 2.because that was there only chance to show maitrey ramakirshnans n*de butt and they waisted it. If she said that filming those scenes was no big deal then why not show it? they built up Devi doing you know what and even one of the posters for the series shows Devi in some blankets. They made it seem important but instead they pulled a megamind 2 and made everyone angry, and the worst part is the creator of the show Mindy kaling confirmed we won’t get any new content with Devi meaning we’ll be stuck longing for an important plot line that never happened and also seeing devis a**. you’re telling me you can show a deer man becoming a black goopy eldritch horror straight out of Trevor Henderson with an unsettling lullaby but you can’t show two friends getting romantic? hopefully Mindy kaling makes up for this.

First off, presenting Sean Penn as “middle aged man” is like saying Donald Trump is a centrist. It’s a gross mischaracterization and immediately sets the wrong vibe. While I get he’s not supposed to ultimately be sinister, it’s impossible to not see the red flags that any sane woman alone at night in a car with him would not have waving in her face furiously. \n\nThe conversation is interesting and not dissimilar from some I have had in my many (mostly Uber) rides with a driver. I generally prefer dead silence, but if the ride is longer than 30 or 45 minutes it’s almost impossible to avoid. \n\nIn my experience through a variety of avenues, guys that tend to be this blunt and aggressively open right off the bat end up having not great intentions. It’s the “fly off the handle” type that expects some result that if it does not go right to plan it’s the nuclear option. \n\nThe movie is ok, the scenario is hard to keep realistic in your head and the casting is bad. Someone like Ruffalo or Renner would have been far more palatable because, you know, they are actually middle aged and not 60+ year old men with sexual violence histories in real life. \n\nWatchable but not award worthy by any means.

        "selftext": "Morgan crashing the bar mitzvah knowing she was not invited and knowing the family did not want her there, and that a grieving woman would suffer by her presence is a good example. Or at the very least they knew that Morgan’s presence would stir up drama. This event was an important rite of passage for the teenage niece and should have been a time for the family to focus on her. It was not about Morgan or her drama. It was not about Joanna or her drama. \n\nJoanna crashes Noah’s sermon unannounced (place of work) and is pissed she has to wait 15 minutes for him. He did his absolute best to rush out of there, but by the time he finds Joanna, she has already had her sister show up to bitch and *rescue* her. Maybe this isn’t narcissistic as much as a weird combo of needy, insecure and demanding. \n\nYes, Joanna confessed to going through the private box. But she failed to mention that it wasn’t just her snooping, but she was with her mom and her sister, all of them sitting around mocking Rebecca and laughing and making a show out of looking through somebody’s private belongings. That is more than just letting insecurities get the best of her, this came across as a symptom of a pathological lack of empathy and a casual disregard for personal boundaries, two signs of narcissism. \n\nIn the ick episode, Joanna leaves Noah alone with her nutty parents because she gets the ick. When you are introducing a new dating partner to your family, your role is to make that person feel comfortable around all these new people and support them. But she disappears, leaving him to wonder what the hell happened and then he eventually finds her out by the pool, where she’s in some sort of crisis about his blazer. If someone I was newly seeing did that to me, I’m sorry, but there’d be some boundaries drawn. \n\nThis last example is a bit harder to explain, but I’ll try. Why was Morgan completely morally expunged once Joanna finds out she had “told the truth” about what Rebecca had told her at the bar? Morgan’s behavior itself was callous and cruel. That is what should have been addressed. \n\nObviously characters shouldn’t be perfect, but the lack of awareness from the writers is what bothered me. They seemed to think that Morgan and Joanna were the quirky, sassy, loveable kind of flawed, not like an untreated personality disorder kind of flawed. \n\nI wouldn’t give a shit, except for the fact that I just keep hearing about what an emotionally aware show this is, how healthy the relationship is, how much people identify with Joanna. I feel alone in this and so I thought I’d throw it out there to see if anyone feels the same way. ",

Dr Patrick Steptoe (played by Bill Nighy) and scientist Robert ‘Bob’ Edwards. \n\nBut Google's results leave a gaping hole in the history of the creation of IVF – the vital contributions of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie) who was only commemorated by the Royal Society of Biology in 2015. \n\nIn the end, it was Jean who provided not only the ‘last piece of the puzzle that made IVF possible’ but also the voice desperately needed to bring this ‘incredible’ part of British history to the big screen.\n\n‘If this film is a reminder of the sacrifices that have been made by women, some good men, but mostly women, and how therefore we should protect that progress at every cost, then fantastic,' said Norton.\n\nYou can [**read the full article here**](https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/19/james-norton-i-took-ivf-granted-learned-shocking-truth-21940171/)",

At its heart is Don Fabrizio Corbera, the Prince of Salina, who leads a life surrounded by beauty and privilege. But as Italy moves towards unification and the old aristocratic order is threatened, he realizes that his family’s future is in jeopardy. New allegiances must be made, each one a threat to his principles. Eventually Don Fabrizio is faced with an impossible choice. He has the power to engineer a marriage, between the rich and beautiful Angelica and his nephew Tancredi, that could secure his family’s legacy but, doing so would break his favorite daughter, Concetta’s heart. The series will be a modern exploration of timeless themes — power, love, and the cost of progress.\n\nDIRECTOR: Tom Shankland, Giuseppe Capotondi, Laura Luchetti  \nWRITER: Richard Warlow, Benji Walters  \nBASED ON THE BOOK: The Leopard (Original Title: Il Gattopardo) by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\n\nKEY CAST: Kim Rossi Stuart, Benedetta Porcaroli, Deva Cassel, Saul Nanni\n\nTEASER: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DS9ERfLjk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0DS9ERfLjk)",

        "title": "Looking for a show to watch? List of 5 of the best shows I have seen",
        "selftext": "People around me tell me that I give the best recommendations for shows and movies. You can basically be sure that whatever I recommend to you will not be in vain, and you'll likely share similar feelings to mine. I take a lot of pride in the fact that people respect the recommendations I give, along with the thoughts I share about a show or film. So, I refuse to do anything that might jeopardize that. Below is a list of shows (in no particular order) that I hold in the same regard as *Breaking Bad* (not all of the recommendations I give right now will have similar plots to *Breaking Bad*, such as drug dealing or gangs, but some will). Also, I am FAR FROM a good writer. So my writing may be a bit sloppy, or bland... but just trust me that these are some of the best shows you can watch. Each of them had a similar factor. I got extremely in to them to the point I would stand up, cry, or talk to the TV; and I basically watched most of them in a few sittings if not one alone. You will won't be bored for a while if you go through this list and watch each one. Here we go though!\n\n1. **Snowfall** 8/10 A solid show. It starts off feeling a bit cheesy with the acting and something about Franklin felt goofy to me at the start. However, the character development is outstanding, and the actors seem to find their footing as the show progresses. Take my criticism with a grain of salt because the show is definitely not a slow burn. It starts strong and captivating, only continuing to get better (until season 4).\n2. **3%** 9.5/10 A phenomenal show, truly a hidden gem, and in my opinion, the king of hidden gems. If a show truly deserves a 10/10 rating, this is one of the few that comes close. Some of the best acting I’ve ever seen, with exceptional character development. I became so attached to some characters and truly despised others. What makes the show unique is that there isn’t a clear \"good guy/bad guy\" dynamic. While the show guides you toward who you’re supposed to root for, you can still choose your own \"home team\" without having your experience ruined. The show excels in its realism—real in the way people react to events and situations. It provides a genuine depiction of what the world could be like, even in its dystopian setting. There isn't much \"evil\"; instead, you see people doing what they think is right, even if others view their actions as evil. I watched it in its original Portuguese because the dubbed English version didn’t do justice to the actors' performances—and frankly, it was poorly done, as most English dubs are. The show is filled with twists and turns, and it's almost never predictable. An incredible mind-bender of a show.\n3. **Ozark** 8/10 Another strong show. For some reason, I tried starting it about four times before I finally got into it—I can't remember why. This show excels in almost all aspects: plot, acting, character development, and twists that are far from predictable. The pacing is smooth, and the plot is captivating. There are moments where you notice something but don’t think much of it, only to realize how pivotal it was 30 episodes later. I love shows with well-written foreshadowing, and *Ozark* is one of them.\n4. **Attack on Titan** 9.5/10 I understand not everyone is into anime, but I truly believe anyone can watch *Attack on Titan* and love it. In my opinion, it’s one of (if not *the*) greatest stories ever told. It doesn’t rely on typical anime clichés like over-the-top humor or fan service. The acting is great (both the sub and dub, although the sub is infinitely better), and it feels like regular TV—despite being animated. The first episode grabs your attention in a huge way. While the show might seem a bit slow after that, be patient—the first season is just laying the foundation. I wouldn’t call it a slow burn, but the first season is one of the less captivating ones. Once you reach the middle of the third season, nearly every episode has you on the edge of your seat. Not many shows can make me stand up or talk to the TV, but *Attack on Titan* did it repeatedly. It’s one of the most well-written shows of all time, with incredible foreshadowing, mind-blowing twists, and unforgettable characters. It explores the gray areas of good and evil in a way few shows do. The second half of the series is almost a new show, yet it still feels like the same one. It's hard to explain, but you’ll understand if you watch it. This show has everything to be peak fiction—nothing is missing. The ending was set from the very beginning, which is rare in storytelling. Every storyline and loose end is tied up in a way that’s incredibly satisfying. I cried multiple times and had my mind blown on more than one occasion. SO many twists. A perfect show.\n5. **White Lotus** 8.5/10 Another hit. I don’t typically enjoy comedies or shows that try too hard to be funny (not that I’d call *White Lotus* a comedy), because more often than not, I find them forced and unfunny. But this show had me laughing on several occasions. It doesn't let the humorous moments overshadow the overall tone of the show, nor does it detract from its urgency or seriousness. The show portrays society and the human psyche in a way that feels incredibly real. Throughout, you feel as though you’re watching a story that could happen in real life, even though the events are outrageous. The characters' reactions to events make sense, and I found myself comparing them to people I know. The acting is excellent, and each character feels authentic. At times, I was amazed at how much they resembled real people—not in appearance, but in their actions. It’s over the top at times, but never to the point where it feels unreal. A remarkable show.",

Does the check mark still means that transitions are reduced, or since is blue with the checkmark that transitions are actually enabled and can be seen?",

These people lived in different areas of the US. It seems it was very widespread but Netflix is completely ignoring it and gaslighting us with how successful it was to not upset investors.  I guess they are not wanting to engage and hope it fizzles out while they correct internal issues before next stream, essentially making us beta testers.  \n\nI had friends over and spent an hour fucking with my home network thinking it was on my end until I saw others reporting issues.  It was beyond frustrating... then when it did work it looked like dog shit... I pay for 4k/HDR.  This is 2024, the scaling technology is there, yet they cut corners somewhere at the expense of its customers.  Oh well... cancelled just on principle. Ive been with them since early DVD delivery era.  Sorry, just ranting... tired of greedy corporations bending us over.  \n\nEDIT:  I should have included that they 'sort of' acknowledged it per the CTO to their EMPLOYEES... nothing publicly, at least not that I know of yet. \nhttps://x.com/markgurman/status/1857903507694915931\n\nUpdate (11/20/24): Looks like a class action lawsuit has started in regard to the streaming issues:\nhttps://www.thewrap.com/mike-tyson-jake-paul-netflix-lawsuit-livestream-issues/",

        "selftext": "I've paid for Netflix for my immediate family (Parents, brother) since sometime in 2018.  I've lived alone, they still all live at the house where I grew up.   2 houses, 4 profiles.  So yes, that was bad and I was part of the problem.  Bad TitanSerenity.  Bad.  Moving on.  When they announced they were cracking down on sharing, I was like \"Fine, whatever, we'll pay for the extra household or whatever thing.\"\n\nFast forward to last night, my brother tried to log in and finally got caught, and got the popup about households.  I \\*thought\\* that I'd made the right adjustments to my account when the notice came out back in spring, but apparently not.  \n\nSo I crated a member account, which he activated, and we transferred his profile.  All went well.  \n\nThen we go to transfer Mom and Dad's profiles to that member account, becuase they're the same 'household'/would be coming from the same public IP.   Only to then find out that Member Accounts can't have more than one profile.  \n\nSo this is really stupid, because if you're restricting it to IP/Geo, what's it matter?  After talking to support, it turns out it would've been perfectly viable to make myself the member (since I live alone and only have one profile), and leave them on the 'main' account so they can have multiple profiles at THAT location.  \n\nBut support tells me that once the profile is moved off the main account, it can't be moved back.    \nWTF is that?  There's zero technical reason for that.  None.  So I can't undo what we did and fix it. \n\nSo now, basically I'm going to have to jump through a bunch of hoops to create accounts, move profiles, etc etc, only to end up at the same place they won't let me go.  I'm going to end up within the rules, at one household with 3 profiles on it, and a member account with one profile on it.  Why are you going to make me do all the gymnastics to do the thing I can just go do anyway?  Completely assinine.  \n\nI already have the technical infrastructure in place to do the thing that I can't say I can do on this sub.  I'm half tempted to do it now just out of spite. \n\nDid I miss something? Is there an easier way to do this?  ",

Big mistake, apparently, because after making that change one time, every single movie or show that I start has portuguese audio and subtitles, and I have to change it back to english. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe PS5 app doesn't have any \"default language\" settings that I can find, aside from one on the show page that seems to be specific to that show. Of course, changing this to english doesn't stick - every time I come back to a show it has been changed back to portuguese.\n\nMy phone app does have a \"Manage Profiles\" option which allows me to select a language. I changed this to english. In fact, I have changed it to english several times over the last few days, and it keeps changing itself back to portuguese.\n\nThe \"Manage Profiles\" option on the netflix website also has a language option, though this appears to impact the menus rather than the in-show audio. This has been english all along and has not changed.\n\nI have tried logging out and logging back in. I have deleted the app from my devices and redownloaded it. I have logged out of ALL devices and changed everything I could back to english. Nothing changes. On every device, everything always defaults back to portuguese. It's driving me insane.\n\nHas anyone else had a problem like this? Am I missing a hidden setting somewhere? Or do I just have to accept my fate and learn portuguese to continue using Netflix?\n\nEDIT: after some more experimentation I have managed to get to a place where movies play in english, but shows still play in portuguese. This makes even less sense to me, but I guess it's a slight improvement?",

As the captain of the Iron Dragons team, he is certainly a cut above than everyone else in the Sekai Taikai, and he even managed to kill Kwon, who was hyped up to be a huge threat during Season 6 part 1.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Axel is so tall (I think the guy is almost 2 m) gives him a big advantage.\n\nIt is clear that no one from Cobra Kai or Karate Kid universe is strong enough to defeat Axel, not even Mr. Miyagi or Kim Sun Yung in their primes.  \nHence, in order to make this a fairer fight, I will be using a fighter from another martial art-focused series, *Dragon Ball Super* (anime).\n\nI am pretty sure that lots of you in this forum are familiar with Dragon Ball Super. Son Goku is the protagonist, and throughout the series, he undergoes significant development in both strength and wisdom.\n\nWith that being said, who do you think would win this fight, Goku or Axel?\n\nI will be making multiple rounds here:\n\nRound 1: Axel vs Base Goku  \nRound 2: Axel vs Super Saiyan Goku  \nRound 3: Axel vs Super Saiyan 2 Goku  \nRound 4: Axel vs Super Saiyan 3 Goku  \nRound 5: Axel vs Super Saiyan God Goku  \nRound 6: Axel vs Super Saiyan Blue Goku  \nRound 7: Axel vs Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x10 Goku  \nRound 8: Axel vs Mastered Ultra Instinct Goku\n\nBonus round: if it is too much of a stomp in favor of Axel in all 6 rounds, then, we do Axel vs Whis. Since Whis is also very tall, I think we can have a fairer fight here.\n\nThe battles take place in the Sekai Taikai tournament arena.\n\nWho wins?\n\n",

        "title": "Why Netflix’s Marco Polo Series was Peak and Deserves a Third Season",
        "selftext": "Alright, hear me out. Netflix’s Marco Polo was actually one of the most underrated gems out there. The production quality? Insane. The characters? Iconic. The potential? ENDLESS. We’re talking Game of Thrones-level world-building, but with Mongolian steppes and Silk Road intrigue instead of dragons (no hate to dragons, but Kublai Khan was his own kind of beast). Let’s dive into why this show was pure peak and why Netflix really owes us a Season 3.\n\nFirst up, Marco and Jingim’s dynamic was one for the ages. I mean, c’mon—Marco, the Italian outsider, and Jingim, the heir to the Khanate? It wasn’t just a classic “buddies who can’t stand each other” thing; it was like watching two people who knew they had to learn from each other to survive. Marco’s worldview and knowledge from the West gave Jingim a different perspective, and vice versa. But it wasn’t some sappy bromance—they constantly had that “are we enemies or are we brothers?” vibe. Watching their grudging respect evolve was actually satisfying AF.\n\nThen we had Byamba, Kublai’s other son, who was a straight-up wild card. Byamba was that guy who could’ve gone either way—totally loyal one minute, ready to throw it all away the next. He’s got Kublai’s blood, but he’s way more rebellious and has no interest in all the traditional rules that Jingim is bound by. His interactions with Marco had this “unlikely allies” energy, like they both understood what it felt like to be outsiders, even if for different reasons. Honestly, Marco kind of needed both of these relationships to survive Kublai’s court; Jingim taught him loyalty, and Byamba taught him adaptability.\n\nAlso, let’s talk Kublai Khan. This guy wasn’t just a brutal conqueror; he was a super complex ruler who respected Marco but also low-key saw him as a threat. I mean, that relationship? Tense. Kublai was like, “I could kill you in a heartbeat, but hey, you’re kind of useful.” He was layered, not just some caricature of a leader, which made his scenes all the more intense. Marco Polo didn’t shy away from showing how every decision Kublai made was about holding onto power, balancing loyalty, and maintaining family connections. He was ruthless, sure, but relatable? Weirdly, yes. By Season 2, I was more invested in his life than Marco’s half the time.\n\nAnd can we talk about Hundred Eyes? This man was easily one of the greatest mentors in any series. His wisdom, the way he balanced loyalty and his own sense of honor—it was all just legendary. He even got his own spin-off episode, which just proved how strong his character was. That spin-off was so good it felt like a teaser, but then…nothing. Like, c’mon Netflix, you gave us a taste, and then left us high and dry. There’s so much more we could’ve explored with him and his relationship with Marco and the whole “wise mentor” dynamic that made us care so much.\n\nThe series had serious potential for a Season 3. They left so many threads open! There was Marco’s return to Italy still looming, and the impact his years in the East would’ve had on him and, honestly, on Europe. Plus, the romance, political drama, the family feuds, and literal battles—it was like we were on the brink of watching the world change. We could’ve seen Jingim stepping up, Marco finding himself in his “real home” of the Khanate, Byamba stirring the pot in his own rebellious way, and Kublai facing enemies on all sides, both foreign and family. Don’t tell me Netflix doesn’t see the potential here—like, we all saw it!\n\nLook, if Netflix can greenlight five seasons of Emily in Paris, they can give us one more of Marco Polo. The fans are still here. Just scroll through the subreddits, the YouTube comments, the tweets—everyone’s STILL talking about it. Imagine the hype if they announced Season 3, how they could bring back that mix of historical drama, action, and stunning visuals (shoutout to those Mongolia scenes, BTW).\n\nIn conclusion, if you’re listening, Netflix: Marco Polo was peak TV. The show deserves a conclusion, the fans deserve closure, and honestly, we all deserve to see Kublai, Marco, Byamba, Jingim, and Hundred Eyes in action one last time. Bring it back for the culture.",

The video has tons of artifacts, occasionally stutters, etc. This isn’t the case with any other streaming service and wasn’t a problem earlier in the year…\n\nGoogle OS Netflix on the TV works fine and I have a Roku connected to another TV which is on WiFi that also has no issues.\n\nThe Apple TV is the second version of the 4k model, with a wired network connection. Usually I’ve got it set to match range/frame rate and tried turning those off to see if that was the issue… obviously didn’t fix it. It looks like what you’d expect from a laggy connection but it definitely isn’t laggy - speed benchmark apps show what I’d expect and, as noted, there’s no issues with other apps on the ATV or with Netflix on other devices. Definitely not an HDMI connection/handshake issue since there are no problems with other apps or the screen going blank, etc. Just wondering if others have had similar issues with Netflix on their Apple TV and if they found a solution",

If you look at Tyson’s walk out you can see it all over his face he already knows everyone is about to see this lie they were selling. He looks worrying or sad, not about the fight, but what everyone is about to see.\nI’d go as far to say that someone should get sued for this. They advertise the fight as being real and all out. Leading up to the fight both sides are saying how ready and how crazy of a battle it’s going to be. ALL FALSE ADVERTISING. Then the entire time they are CLEARLY signaling to each other.

        "selftext": "\n\nWhile last night's Netflix boxing event had its share of controversy, the undercard matches delivered exceptional entertainment value, overshadowing the main event itself.\n\n## Goyat vs. Nunes: A Mismatch of Experience\nThe evening opened with Goyat facing Nunes in what proved to be a clear mismatch between professional and amateur levels. While Nunes showed remarkable courage by lasting the entire bout, Goyat's showboating and unnecessary theatrics overshadowed what could have been a more dignified victory. The disparity in skill levels was evident, and Goyat could have ended things much earlier.\n\n## Ramos vs. Barrios: Undercard Steals the Show\nThe second bout between Ramos and Barrios emerged as a genuine crowd-pleaser. This matchup exemplified everything fans love about boxing – two evenly matched fighters trading blows in a contest that kept spectators on their feet throughout. The bout's outcome remained uncertain until the final bell, delivering the kind of excitement that makes boxing great.\n\n## Taylor vs. Serrano: Netflix's Production Shines\nThe Taylor-Serrano rematch showcased Netflix's potential in boxing broadcasts. The unfiltered coverage, particularly the close-up shots of battle damage, brought viewers uncommonly close to the action. Serrano's determination, fighting through a significant cut, demonstrated the heart and grit that defines the sport. This match alone made the entire event worthwhile.\n\n## Main Event: Tyson vs. Paul\nThe highly anticipated main event between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul fell short of expectations. Paul employed a strategic approach, effectively avoiding Tyson's power shots, but the match lacked the impact fans anticipated. While Paul's game plan proved successful, it's becoming evident that he needs to face opponents in his own weight class and experience level. The pattern of carefully selected matchups continues to raise questions about the legitimacy of his career progression.\n\n## Netflix's Boxing Future\nThis event highlighted Netflix's potential in the boxing world. The streaming platform could revolutionize boxing broadcasting by introducing either a weekly Friday night fight card or reviving the spirit of classic ABC Sports' Saturday afternoon programming. If they can consistently deliver undercards of this caliber, they could establish themselves as a major player in boxing broadcasting.\n\nThe value proposition is clear: delivering high-quality boxing content through an existing subscription service represents a significant win for fight fans. If Netflix maintains this level of production quality and match-making (particularly for undercard bouts), they could carve out a meaningful niche in combat sports broadcasting.",

Ie: the murders. \n\nIf this is true, then in the timeline Quinn comes from Summer, Emmy and all the others would have to still be alive. (Also he would have to see that Summer is a lesbian so I would hope he wouldn’t feel as dejected after that). \n\nIt is made very clear that Lucy would not be in existence without Summer’s death. So the only way that older Quinn and Lucy could both exist and follow these rules is if they were on separate timelines entirely. Which makes no sense because then she wouldn’t have found his Time Machine. \n\nAnyone else have any thoughts about how this could work? Overall I did enjoy the movie (the soundtrack was the best part) and I knew it was going to be cheesy going in. ",

This is so infuriating i am really thinking about writing a formal complaint.\n\nAnyone else has this problem?",

Most of the fights between Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul were them hugging each other. I barely saw any actual punches other than a couple of times. I didn't see anyone get a nose bleed, nothing.  People who were there actually paid around $32,392 for floor seats on Vividseats (according to CBS).. I think they should be refunded their money because they didn't get their moneies worth.\n\nI honestly can't believe that Tyson just made 20 million dollars off of that fight while the other guy gets $40 million. There is something seriously wrong about that. There are Americans busting their asses off having 2+ more jobs struggling to put food on the table to feed their families yet 2 \"boxers\" who mostly spent time time hugging each other inside the ring gets millions of dollars for a short duration fight.",

I miss the girls\n\nUpdate 3: 1 round left, Mikes not doing good, he tired. It will be a miracle if he comes back\n\nUpdate 4: Well..... I suppose it could have been worse.

        "selftext": "Just wanted to invite a constructive discussion about the Netflix Fight night:\n\n- The obvious. The stream quality. I've watched many fights through bootleg links and the quality was 10x better than what we've seen tonight. Netflix is using the same servers that are used for their regular content. It's clear that there was oversight in this aspect and Netflix underestimated the shear demand of live streaming. They need to use dedicate servers for this!!!!\n\n- Rosie Perez and Cedric the Entertainer. Cedric's funny even though he stole Kat's joke. Cedric is absolutely unfit to be calling a damn boxing event. Cedric's HORRIBLE and provides no substance.  Snoop was waaaay more entertaining when he called Jakes fight some years ago. Rosie is bland and doesn't truly know boxing beyond her school fights. It's as of Netflix just wrote a check to someone who needed money.\n\n- Disorganization. While I found Serrano' manager's comments hilarious, it was a bit uncalled for from a professional perspective. It honestly showed how much of a shit show this was and it's all on Netflix. \n\n- Future subscriptions. There is no doubt Netflix will eventually add a tier for live streaming and it will be expensive as shit. Consider their contract with NFL, WWE, and their own shows. It will absolutely suck and cost you a premium.\n\nIt's clearly an event out on for casuals and that's fine but ffs don't cut corners. We pay good money already and I'm still pissed you raised the subscription from the 9.99 Netflix so you fucking owe us!!!",

For context, I’m on a 1-gig fiber connection, which is usually extremely reliable and rarely gives me any trouble. However, I’ve found myself needing to refresh the stream on my PC several times to keep it running smoothly.\n\nWhile this isn’t a major issue for me personally, as refreshing on a computer is fairly quick and easy, I can’t help but think about viewers at home who might be watching the stream on their TVs. For those individuals, I imagine it could be quite inconvenient to have to interrupt their viewing experience, potentially get up, and troubleshoot or restart the stream multiple times.\n\nI wanted to bring this up not only to see if others are encountering similar problems but also in case this might be an issue worth investigating further on the technical side. If there’s a broader issue, it might be worth addressing sooner rather than later to ensure a seamless viewing experience for everyone.\n\nLooking forward to hearing if anyone else has noticed this or has insights to share.\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "It feels like **\"Hot Frosty\"** officially kicked off Netflix's *pseudo-Hallmark Christmas Movies* onslaught this year.  It's kind of a high-concept rom-com Christmas movie, basically \"what if *Frosty the Snowman* happened for a widower + Frosty is mad chiseled?\".\n\nOverall, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I thought I would, so if you haven't seen it yet, temper your expectations.  Easily, Dustin Milligan is the standout.  I always liked him from Schitt's Creek, but he was just great in this role, balancing sweet/fish-out-of-water with sincere while pulling off the comedy aspects.  His interaction with Joe Lo Truglio was maybe my favorite part of the movie (probably tied with the 'pushing the woman's car' bit while shirtless + following scenes with the ladies friends were up there).\n\nMy biggest issue with the movie is unfortunately Lacey Chabert (as \"Kathy\").  I'll be honest, I haven't watched most of her Hallmark releases, but here, I just found her to be a surprisingly weak lead for what was a decently stacked cast.  The major problem is that for a movie called \"Hot Frosty\", I didn't feel any *heat* between Kathy and \"Jack\" (the snowman come to life).  Their lack of chemistry really sunk what could have been a much stronger rom-com (*see* **Nobody Wants This** for an example of rom-com leads with both romantic and comedic chemistry).  As a result, I found that my favorite parts of the movie were all scenes *without* her and I was never rooting for them to get together.\n\nNot as big a problem, but I really didn't like what they did for Craig Robinson as the antagonist sheriff.  He just came off as way too unlikable and not all that funny.  I think the character could have been written in a different way to still fulfill that role, but in a funnier/more enjoyable way.\n\nOn the other end of things, it took me a second to recognize Lauren Holly (I don't think I've seen her in much since the *Dumb and Dumber* days).  I was hoping for a reveal that >!her husband also started out as a snowman!<, but that never happened.  It's still my head-canon though.\n\nWhat we got was still enjoyable to a degree, but can't help feeling like this was a missed opportunity.  That said, I'm a 40+ dude, so not sure I'm the target audience haha.  Next on the list, hoping Lindsay Lohan's upcoming **\"Our Little Secret\"** ends up being a lot more fun!",

I've never created a pin and I tried all the pins I would have used if I made it in and it wasn't any of them. I don't know how to watch it.. \nAlso I asked my sister to try to watch the same movie and yes she lives in the same region. And it's not even on her netflix. There is no movie with that name on it.  Please any advice.   Thank you ",

Even when I moved out 12 years ago, I moved into a condo that they owned, and paid them rent.   They used to come out and stay with me for 3-4 months out of the year, until my father passed in 2020.   \n\nUntil recently I was traveling back and staying with my mother for 5-6 months each year, to help her out.   Last time I went back to my place, Netflix forced me to either have her locked out of her profile until I visited again, or I could pay for an extra member.   I did the latter.  \n\nAnd now I've moved back in with my mother, to help take care of things, and want to have her profile transfered back.   I've been told this is impossible, and the only options I have result in her profile getting deleted.   \n\nThat can't be right is it?   If an account can be transfered from one email to another, why can't it be transfered back?   Especially when, the uts the main account thats paying for everything and according to Netflix own rules, we're in the same household now!",

This is exactly what happened with HBO /Max before we cancelled it. I'm thinking about taking this staple service and putting it on the rotation of on for a month off for 11.\n\nI have no interest in reality, sitcom, or live programming. \n\nWhat does my family like? Witty, adventure, and scifi/fantasy. We're up for a good procedural cop story too - but we'd be in it for the characters/mystery and not have much interest in gore/horror.\n\nMy wife and I just started big door prize and just finished severance on Apple tv. These both look like they were probably low budget (no special effects dominating the screen), though maybe the talent cost some money. The thing that really marks these shows as interesting is that they have good solid writing and story telling chops.\n\nOutside of stranger things, Netflix doesn't appear to know how to pick shows that are what most of us would call good. (Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to finance the man who ruined the DC universe?) At this point it appears to be a strategy and that I'm simply not in the target market.

He was friends or became friends with this other middle age man with blonde hair (I see his face so vividly but do NOT know where he’s from). \nI’m pretty sure the “friend” the detective made was actually the father or step father of this girl who was killed by the serial killer.

Just to rule out network issues on my side, I upgraded to a 750 Mbps plan and receive a steady 940 Mbps via Ethernet, so speed limitations aren't a factor here.\n\nDoes anyone else see the same with *Alita* or other Netflix titles?

Do others notice this or am I just too difficult to profile?",

The friendships, the treasure hunting, the actors, everything seemed so genuine. \n\nIdk what it is about Season 4, but it just seemed off. It felt rushed if that makes sense. I feel like the actors aren’t as interested, but they have to “stay interested” since it’s their job. Obviosuly, there is something that all us fans don’t know, and will likely never know. \n\nI’m hoping that season 5 is good, maybe they’ll use the blue crown to bring JJ back? \n\nAnyways, what do you all think about season 4? I know a lot of people disliked the ending, but we have to give the directors a chance, they might be writing something really good for S5! ",

Aucun film ne se lance, peu importe l'appareil ou le contenu choisi.\n   * J'ai essayé plusieurs appareils (téléphone, TV, PC), mais le problème persiste sur tous.\n   * J’ai déjà effectué toutes les étapes classiques pour résoudre ce genre de problème : redémarrage des appareils, vérification de la connexion Internet, suppression du cache de l’application, et déconnexion/reconnexion de mon compte Netflix. Rien ne semble fonctionner.\n3. **Ce que j'ai essayé :**\n   * Redémarrer mes appareils et mon routeur.\n   * Vider le cache de l’application Netflix sur tous les appareils.\n   * Déconnecter et reconnecter mon compte Netflix.\n   * Créer un nouveau profil sur Netflix, mais le problème persiste.\n   * Tester plusieurs contenus vidéo, mais le problème est le même partout.\n4. **Mon hypothèse :** Je pense que le problème pourrait être lié à la gestion des connexions et à un conflit avec l’authentification ou la synchronisation des appareils après la désactivation des connexions précédentes. Peut-être que Netflix bloque temporairement l'accès ou n'arrive pas à gérer correctement la session à cause de cette manipulation.\n\nEst-ce que quelqu'un a déjà eu ce problème ou a une idée de comment résoudre ça ? Si vous avez une solution, je suis preneur !\n\nMerci d'avance pour vos retours.",

Plus Arcane and ATLA are both beautifully animated original shows. LOTR and GoT obviously have a very similar fantasy setting and they are both based on books too.

Something modern we can sink our teeth into, that follows on from the famous military veterans testifying in Congress! \n\nI am absolutely so desperate for another season, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed watching this. Please give us more! It’s exactly what the World needs right now, the uncovering of current truth about “are we alone”, “why are these things still being kept secret when it’s now undeniable” WE WANT THE TRUTH! And George Knapp is fighting for us all! \n\n!SPOILER! A thing that hit deep - \n\nSo, when they mentioned helicopters appearing around the time of sightings in Phoenix; and they said it was really common for that to happen - it threw me and my partner! We live in the hills,\nMountain ranges; in an extremely local community, low crime where nothing would ever warrant helicopters… During Covid lockdowns - my partner and I struggled with sleeping and became aware of helicopters flying overhead around 2-4am most nights!

Idk who the directors were behind this past seasons but they def have to get fired. not only did it feel so chaotic and disjointed, it also just full on transformed from a show about a friend group to  a fantasy about treasure hunters. not only that but the fact that there was some type of cliffhanger every 10 seconds shows how completly unrealistic this plot was. Especially w that cop who's somehow the town only working officer, investigator, auctioneer, and pathologist. like it genuinely hurts me at the fact that they ruined an actual good show and even though I still had hope after season 3 now its just completely trash. smh",

The 2024 one where now the parents have lost both their daughter\n\n2. One that Summer stays alive and has a life with Lucy, which keep in mind now a security guard is now dead along with the other 2 of summer friends.\n\n3. A whole separate time line when Lucy killed future Quinn, aka the time line we seen when Lucy killed Quinn in the parking garage. I’m supposing when she went back to her house and seen summer is alive and they (Summer and the parents) clearly don’t recognize her bc summer lived so therefore no Lucy\n\n4. The timeline where everyone lives (summer and her friends) and Quinn turns bad aka going to the past to kill summer and her friends. So prior to him going back in time there is a universe where every single one of the friends live and Quinn just disappears.\n\nThis is all so confusing, mainly the part that messes me up is how Lucy is even able to have a life in the 2003 time line with Summer.

        "selftext": "I've noticed something strange lately while streaming Universal Pictures movies on Netflix – every Universal title I’ve tried maxes out at 540p quality when I’m watching on my PC. I’m using Edge, and all other content, like Netflix Originals and even non-Universal movies, stream in full 1080p without any issues, so I don’t think it’s my setup.\n\nMovies that I tested\n\n* Get out\n* Halloween (2018)\n* Sing\n* Super Mario Bros\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this? Could it be a licensing or encoding issue specific to Universal Pictures on PC? I’m going to check if the quality improves on a Smart TV, but if anyone’s already done this test, I’d really appreciate some insight.\n\nWould love to know if this is a common problem.",

Aka, if I watch on average on an hour a day aka (30 hours/month) \n\nAt a price differential of $8.50 (15.50-7.00). \n\nAnd here’s the hard part, on an aggregate basis how many ads and commercial time is there per hour of content. This seems quite variable. For the sake of argument let’s say it is 4 minutes per hour. No idea accuracy of that.\n\nSo that’s 30x4= 120 minutes = 2 hours so that would be $4.25/hour. Based on that it feels like it might be worth it; obviously very dependent on how much you watch, and ad density, and personal finances. \n\nThoughts? Any better assumptions on minutes of ads per hour?",

        "selftext": "This show has overplayed its hand. It's just no longer good. And I say this as a fan. I loved the first 3 seasons but it's time to call it a day. \n\nAll the characters have become caricatures of themselves. A shell. Like we get it. Pope is worried about his future and is angsty about all the pressure on him. JJ is a screw up who's throwing his life away but its not his fault, his dad was abusive. Jon B and Sara are in love. But oh wait, Topper is a threat to their relationship and somehow still a jerk after 3 separate redemption arcs that didn't stick. That Rafe guy is Craaaaazy. Oh my godd Kiaras parents are so gonna ground her again. Here comes Shoupe, the good hearted cop who's hands are always tied by higher ups and never believes the kids despite them always being right. *swampy adventure treasure hunt with dangerous men trying to kill them enues, but dont worry, this Rag tag group of 150 pound uneducated teenagers will always find a way to get the drop on trained hitmen*\n\nThey have discovered 3 separate priceless treasures and have *NO* money.  And nothing but a raggedy dock shop to show for it and it's already in danger. And this is the crux of the treasure hunter genre with sequels. It's why they never made a National Treasure 3. Because for starters. Treasure hunting is extremely dangerous and often unfruitful. So if you have an ungodly amount of money from all the treasure you've found, you're unlikely to keep risking it unless you've just developed some like, sick obsession. But at the end of the day. Audiences don't connect with rich people making themselves richer. Also when youre rich you have a bunch of resources that take the fun out of treasure hunting. So in order to keep the characters hunting for treasure the author needs to keep the treasure hunters poor. So what does the author do? They have somebody steal the treasure. But the problem therein lies that the story ceases to be about chasing clues for a long lost treasure and instead just becomes a fight to the death for money. So they have the treasure reveal an even bigger treasure or the absolute worst thing is when they make the characters EXTEMELY stupid with their money and lose it all (looking at you JJ). But even so, you can only do all this so many times before it becomes absurd and redundant. \n\nDon't get me wrong it's kinda poetic to see each character have some old unknown family ties to a treasure. But the treasure is no longer tied to the Royal Merchant. And thats the sad part is I thought the first 3 seasons were good. And minus the cliffhangers for season 4 I think the end of season 3 would be the perfect send off point for the story. The royal merchant leads them to the cross of Santo Domingo which leads them to el Dorado. The story that begins with Cameron ward killing John sr ends with both of them dying. It wrapped everything up nearly in a bow. \n\nThe story now lacks vision and direction. The actors all hate eachother now and it bleeds through. And it got so bad that they broke their formula and actually killed off a main character. But as predictable as this story has become I can only assume they are gonna slide Rafe over into JJs role as the wild card of their group. And just to keep things nice and symmetrical I bet they'll even spark a romance between Kiara and Rafe. And since every great story still needs an antagonist, I can only assume Topper will fill that role solo now. And Sara's pregnancy? Slim chance that sticks. They will probably just have her miscarry. But on the slim chance she doesn't, im guessing timeskip into everyone being retired from treasure hunting and JB and Sara are parents but they get pulled back in when their baby gets kidnapped or threatened. IDK. There's not many options. All I do know is this show should have concluded with the 3rd season.",

YouTube looks normal, so I don't see why it'd be an issue with my TV.

Like, instead of working on pushing out the final stranger things season, maybe try pushing out follow-ups to shows that abruptly ended. I think a lot of you may not agree with me on this, but Netflix needs to keep making good shows that might make them tons of money in the future. Also, I am hate “leave the world behind” because it’s basically one big advertisement for “FRIENDS”. ",

Basically, am I going to get decent 1080p content with a 1080p subscription or for good quality 1080p content I actually need to go with the 4k subscription instead since Netflix maybe condenses 1080p content on the 4k subscription less?",

        "selftext": "Here's an interesting story...\n\nI created my Netflix account back in 2018 in Romania, where I've always lived. I received a free month as it was back then without having to submit any payment information. At the end of that first free month, I went on a one-week vacation in Barcelona. During this vacation, I received a notification from Netflix that my complimentary month was ending so I had to add my payment details to continue my membership, which I did. At that time, I the Standard Plan cost the same in Spain as in Romania. I used my PayPal account to pay for the membership, by the way, so I didn't notice anything weird about it.\n\nFast forward six years, and today I got an email from Netflix telling me that they're increasing the price to 13.99 euros. As I don't usually pay much attention to my automatic subscriptions (I know, my bad!) the price sounded pretty high so I went to the Netflix Romania website where to my surprise, the Standard plan cost only 9.99 euros. So I was like, WTF!? Taking a look at my payment history I see that at least for the last few years, I've been paying 12.99 euros for the Standard Plan. While talking to support, they asked me if I live in Spain because all along I've been paying the cost for the Spanish Standard Plan. I told the support, that I live in Romania and haven't visited Spain since 2018. Of course, they told me there was nothing they couldn't do about it and that I should cancel my current plan and restart it again after it expires to switch to the Romanian price.\n\nOf course, I am partially to blame for this situation, but since Netflix can easily find multiple people abusing a single account, can't they figure out you have lived for the past 6 years in a country and paid the membership for another country? At least a notification or something, FFS.\n\nSo yeah, I'm canceling and never getting back! \"Thanks\", Netflix",

It started out with her relationship with JJ before getting into details about Bobby (I think they might have used an alternative name to Bobby?). It didn't include any interviews with her family, and was just her telling story. It also didn't include an interview with Bobby and wife, or any photos of actual Bobby. It did include details about the intimacy they had over phone, and I think they showed a photo of her cousin and also sound clips she had from \"Bobby\". I'm banging my head against a wall trying to find out what the hell it was I watched but all I'm getting is Sweet Bobby.

The long arc dealing with her prosecution for Insider Trading and eventual incarceration was harrowing. Superb film and highly recommended.",

        "selftext": "The diplomat season 1 was one of my favourites netflix shows in a long time. The writing was sharp, nuance and interesting. Kate and Hal have the fish out of the water situation that sometimes is ridiculous, but grounded with discussion about foreign policy and politics.\n\nI was so excited for second season to the point that I rewatched the first season last week. And it still hold up to what I remember. The was a nice blend between homeland and the west wing. Tension and idealism. The writing was so masterfully crafted that I replayed some of the dialogs.\n\nI'm very surprise and somewhat disappointed about season 2. There are still glimpses of the good show from season 1 of course but going through it feel like a slog, compared to season 1 where I felt like I couldn't get enough. \n\nFrom storypoint perspective, it moves very slowly and unclear where things are going, except for a few notable scenes such as the church and hosptial discussion scene. Kate and Eidra convo is always a stand out from season 1 but it feels like that overdo it just because it worked well last season. \n\nKate as a character feels stuck. At least a few months have passed in the show and she still doesn't remember her staff names and only talkes to a few people again and again. For someone who supposedly a very successful diplomat in a wat zone, she sure has the biggest chip and her shoulder and cant even do well with managing her office and staff. Sure she doesn't like the photoshoot and wearing fancy dresses but grow up. That's the job, she cant just treat her staff badly because of her stress.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a criticism on Kerry Russel who have been brilliant and I've admired from The Americans time.\n\nStuart is just insufferable here. I don't need to explain. He used to be so cool last season.\n\nThe Denisson and Kate relationship are just ridiculous now. It was a little bit eye brow raising last season on how much the supposedly party olanning only role for American ambassador has so much push over a British foreign minister. This season is just absurb. He comes to her any time she calls and he just told her the supposed Throwbridge push just as an aside, even though it's huge to tell the US that the UK is going to replace their own PM. \n\nTo be fair I'm only at episode 3 and the only reason I hang on is I know Allison Janney is coming soon. But it's already have the show and we barely have anything happening.\n\nI wonder why the writing took such a nosedive. It's not just about the plot, but the dialogs between characters are so awkward and unnatural. I wonder if it's because of the writers strike that happened and of it affects across the industry. Thinking about House of the Dragon who also had a similar writing nose dive in the second season after an acclaimed first.\n\nHanging on to this and hope the next few episodes would change my mind.

It was about **3 kids** who worked together as a secret team. They had a lair and everything, **(2 guys, 1 girl,)** with an advanced sci-fi esque car, *I do not recall it talking* but it had different abilities and forms depending on the monster of the week. The main setting was their own school, a cliche middle school setting.\n\nThese monsters of the week were animated in a children's crayon art style. They would scribble and move like a kindergartners drawing. *I do not remember if they were drawings that came to life, or if this was just the show's art style.* There would be a scene every episode where they would get stumped by the monster, return to their lair and think of a new plan. The lair was either a cave or one of the characters basements.\n\nI have looked for this show everywhere, I have asked around this Subreddit & the Discord at least once since 2021. I would love to know if this show is genuinely lost or if anyone truly knows what it is. Please, help me find this Netflix show.\"",

The whole point is to watch them when I am not connected to WiFi without using my data. Literally the day before I watched my downloads without issue. I deleted all downloads and downloaded them again, tried different shows, no fix. Maybe I need to reinstall the app?\n\nObviously I could switch my settings from „WiFi only“ to something else, but wouldn’t that mean that I will end up using my data after all? I really don’t wanna test it tho… \n\nI kinda confused and wonder if other people also have that problem… thanks for your help!",

The real question here is did the scammers manage to get hold of my payment date as well as my email address or is this just the fluke of the century?  And, if they did get hold of the payment date, surely the only place they could have obtained this information from is the Netflix system itself.

My faith in the security is now somewhat depleted I have to say.

I’ve grown to like the actor that plays Zuko more but the rest of them aren’t anything like how they are in animations. Their character and personality is but they’re not slim and fit and borderline attractive like they’re shown in the original series (I know it’s weird to say that about a cartoon but wtv) I’m not fat shaming but Azula, Mai and Ty Lee are just chubby lookin kids when they should be slim and look older.

Black sails - not as well known but it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and it’s one of the only shows I’ve been able to watch all the way through again. \n3. The boys - not quite on the level of these others in terms of plot and overall quality but extremely entertaining and a 10/10 performance from Anthony Starr.\n4. Peaky blinders - yes another basic one, but this show has honestly become underrated. It gets too much hate for being “too popular” that people have forgotten how good it actually is!\n5. Vikings - would be higher but the death of Ragnar made me lost interest.\n6. Invincible - only animated series on this list, once again probably not on the same level as these other shows but in terms of personal enjoyment it’s one of my favourites.\n7. Sopranos - I’m gonna say something crazy but I think this show is slightly overrated, the acting is great and it’s entertaining but has a lot of empty episodes that I found myself having to force myself to sit though. That being said it’s still all time and I appreciate that subjectively it’s one of the best of all time.\n8. Barry - the first season is some of the best TV I’ve ever watched and the first half of the last season aswell, it’s a fun watch with some great performances.\n9. Family guy - very different from the others but I’ve watched the whole thing a few times so it has to be here\n10. Ozark - the first and second season are unbelievably good, it sort of drops off from there in my opinion. Still great though. \n\nHonourable mentions - modern family, suits, the Simpson (early episodes), the walking dead (earlier seasons), game of thrones (I only had the chance to watch the first season before it was removed from the streaming service I was using, but will revisit later and revise) and prison break.\n\n\nAlso before you come at me, I haven’t watched shows like breaking bad, snowfall, the wire and etc so will update when i get to it.",

Is that why they’re mad, he just kept torturing them after the game stopped?  I’m so confused!  \n\nOk, also, what was up with the drug dealer?  He was like a DARE dealer.  He was gonna rat them out to the landlord cause their place got messed up?  Huh?  And he was gonna start taking care of her mom to what?  Get her more hooked to drugs?

I also have my own Google TV that I use on the go and it still works outside of the house.\n\n  \nDoes this happen to my father because he is away from the household for too long? Like after a certain amount of time of not being under our wifi does his phone automatically get removed as a device and he has to come back? I'm not 100% sure how this works or how to mange what devices can be authorized or not. \n\n  \nAlso he believes it's because the email address of the Netflix account is not the same as the email address on his iPhone apple account. I don't think this is correct and it has nothing to do with the password sharing thing Netflix is cracking down on but I figured I would say this. I just need someone else to confirm this is not how this works and it is not the cause of him not being to use Netflix on his phone outside the house.",

        "selftext": "I just finished The Frog, and it seems like some people had my reaction where the beginning started off pretty intriguing, but it kind of fell apart and just became increasingly ridiculous for me. I felt like I was setup for this complex and philosophical show, but it ended up feeling like a generic thriller with a very basic Good People vs Bad People morality, with no real character depth. I liked the stylistic choices, including the nonlinear and intentionally confusing editing, but it just felt they were trying to dress up a very generic thriller that didn't really dive into its initial potential.\n\nFor me, at least, what I was anticipating to happen I would have found more interesting. I thought both stories were happening at the same time, and that there was going to be a different reveal - the main antagonist was murdering victims, but then passed the bodies over to her accomplice, the serial killer who gets arrested in the motel. No one suspects the antagonist because the serial killer takes the blame for her kills.\n\nI thought that over time, the two main characters (hotel owner and vacation rental owner) would discover this connection, and start to work together to build the evidence against the antagonist by finding subtle clues she leaves behind during her stays. She stays this initimidating looming presence, instead of the ridiculous character she ends up being, while they try to find ways to trick her into leaving more evidence.\n\nThen, over time, they discover this bigger connection of how she and multiple people are working with her to dispose of her bodies for her. She uses multiple people that go to different hotels that get increasingly difficult to track down.\n\nOverall, I just felt like the show was at its best when it was a slow burn, full of tension, and feel like it could have really capitalized on that. The acting and cinematography were really strong and could have been even stronger with different writing, IMO.\n\nCurious what other people think about the unrealized potential in the show?",

All hopes of renewal are lost as viewership never picks up.\n\n1 and 2 is solely on Netflix management and IDK if anything can be done about it without them re-establishing trust with the audience.\n\n3 seems to be in the hands of showmakers. Maybe drop a satisfying finale every season with some smaller but intriguing threads that can be explored in the next season.\n\nThoughts?",

Obviously Gacy wasn't any rocket scientist too because he wasn't Jack the Ripper who the cops couldn't catch.\n\nOn a different note, John Gacy arguably was both a victim and a villain. His dad used to whack him when he misbehaved and his mum who would catch him stealing her underwear would force him to wear her clothing outside in order that his peers could poke fun at him. This is probably what caused his psychosis besides drugs.",

Online relationships are a very childish and teenage thing (heck I don’t think it’s even a teenage thing anymore in this generation). How can some women be so gullible/oblivious that they keep on claiming to be in a relationship with someone they have never met? Why does it take them so long to realise that it’s all a scam?\nAnd on top of it they say that “catfishing”should be illegal and victim shouldn’t be shamed. Like seriously?! How about first behaving like a 35 year old smart and mature woman?\nMaybe I’m being too harsh but I really don’t understand how these women (or men) think.\n\nPS: I am saying women because most of the series that covers such topics have women as their victims. I am not trying to label any gender here. ",

But the dialogue was so fast and furious and sometimes the subtitles could barely keep up, and sometimes things weren’t clear and at the end there’s a lot of untranslated stuff. Here’s what I need to know:\n\nIs the girl supposed to be the wife of Blondie? She says her mother in law which is Blondie’s mother at one point. That’s what the subtitles say anyway. But they don’t act like they’re married. It’s more like she was someone with a crush on him that wasn’t returned. \n\nAre the grandparents really dead? At the very end the aunt asks where they are and then the movie ends, as if they’ve been dead all along. But then the scene with the grandfather in the hospital would make no sense. But then at the end all the credits are part of the hotel, and there is something with each of the grandparents pictures. But none of the credits are translated so can’t tell if it’s just some random credits or was like a tribute to the grandparents or something confirming that they were dead. \n\nWere the two geckos supposed to mean anything? Through most of the movie I thought they were his dead parents, then at the end, if the grandparents are dead I thought maybe they’re actually them instead. Or were they nobody and just two random geckos?",

I think its been at least 6 months since I tried to watch in a browser.  It was certainly before I installed Sequoia.  Everything is working fine on my streaming devices.  My OS is up to date. Chrome and Safari are the latest. I made sure there were no extensions running in the browser.  I cleared cache, cookies, etc and even rebooted.  Nada.  It does the same thing- plays for a split second when I click the play button and stops.  I can advance the position using the progress slider and the image changes, but it stops playing. I checked the javascript console for any errors and I see nothing there.  The network panel shows that all the netflix pages loaded properly.\n\nI'm not sure what else to check.  Next stop will be Netflix support tomorrow, but I'm not chatting with them at 3AM.  I've already tried everything in their support documentation.\n\nHas anyone experienced this problem recently?  I'm wondering if I have some kind of accessibility option enabled on my system that is detected and aborts playing.  As far as I know there is no dedicated Netflix app for Mac and while the M1 can run ipad/iphone apps as well, the Netflix iOS app is not marked as compatible and cannot be downloaded on the Mac.\n\nUPDATE: The problem appears related to the use of Bose QC Ultra bluetooth earbuds.  Playback worked this morning without them paired, so I tried with them and got the same result as last night.  It pauses immediately after the play button is clicked.",

What really stuck with me was the way Denis Villeneuve captured the intersection of personal tragedy and broader historical conflict, making it feel both intimate and epic at the same time.\n\nIt's not an easy watch, but Incendies is one of those films that stays with you long after the credits roll, forcing you to reflect on the complexities of human nature and the devastating consequences of hatred.\n\nSome other movies that surprised me includes, Children of Men(2006), The Hateful Eight(2015), Tumbbad(2018), The Village(2004).\n\nShare your experiences.",

Turns out he was born in 1925. So he was 8 when na*is came into power, 14 when the war started and 20 when it ended. In 1943 he enlisted with the Luftwaffe to become a fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was deployed. \n\nAfter the war he continued his flight training with the British and was one of the first German pilots to be granted a license by the allied forces. He was also a member of the SPD, which is the social democratic party in Germany. \n\nI'm not saying it's impossible for him to having held auch views at the time, but he was an influenced young man at best. And he wouldn't have gotten training by the British if he was really deep into the politics of the third reich. \n\nIt's just a small thing and I get that they wanted to get the story across that Lou Perlman would have sold his soul to the devil if the money was right. But it comes across as \"Oh my Gosh! He made business with Germans in the 80s and 90s! They must have all been na*is!\", which is rather annoying for us Germans.

        "selftext": "The first ex was so completely oblivious to the double-standards she set. Without batting an eye, she says how she took his new gun and threw it in the trash because \"that's just how I am and I like to press buttons\".\n\nI don't condone violence. But if I spent thousands of dollars on a new guitar/bike/hobby item, and my roommate or girlfriend threw it away \"just because\", violent fantasies would be playing out in my mind.\n\nWhat an absolutely stupid excuse for a human being.\n\nOne thing about all these episodes is they keep talking about how \"XXX\" was the WORST EX EVER. But they never talk about their own roles and things that they did to instigate the treatment they got. I'm not victim blaming, but it almost always takes two to tango.\n\nWhatever it is, that first-ex in the Ben Foster episode was just a dumb POS. She didn't deserve the level of violence brought against her, but man was she dumb and lacking in self-awareness. Apparently getting her finger sliced off wasn't enough to deter her from a second meet. Why? Because the man was hot.",

        "selftext": "Considering accessibility and visual impairments that people may have, I would have expected Netflix to have more customisation than this.\n\nThe large font size is absurdly big and the small font size is absurdly small.\n\nThe majority of subtitles over the years that I have seen in shows have used simple white text with a thick-ish black outline that is easy to read when against a variety of backgrounds. The closest option Netflix has to this is the \"Uniform\" shadow that is a barely noticeable thin outline. Netflix's default font for subtitles is white text with a very subtle shadow behind it. For me, it's hard to read these subtitles when the scene behind it is bright.\n\nThe only reason I still have a Crunchyroll (anime streaming site) subscription is because I don't like Netflix's subtitles.\n\nThe black background font setting, as seen below, is decent for me but I really think Netflix can do a lot better here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sja2zxxtbtvd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=721c9bdc0d8900076367e5b56c32fd4a41f47ff9",
